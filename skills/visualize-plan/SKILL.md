# Visualize Plan

Use this when a text plan already exists and should become a richer HTML review
surface. Call `visualize-plan` with the source text, then enrich the result with
`update-visual-plan` if diagrams, wireframes, mockups, option cards, or explicit
questions would make the plan easier to review.

Wireframes should be concrete enough to critique: layout regions, controls,
states, empty/loading/error paths, review affordances, and copy placeholders.
When the source plan is terse, add README-like detail for slash commands, tool
behavior, install flow, MCP/link fallback, data shape, and scope.

Ask the user to comment in the plan, then call `get-plan-feedback` before
implementation.

If the source is UI-heavy and the user wants a fresh plan instead of a companion,
use `/ui-plan` so an optional top pan/zoom wireframe canvas, rich document
blocks, comments/drawing affordances, and agent handoff come before file
implementation details.
