/**
 * Opt-in bootstrap: copy allowlisted data-source credentials from process.env
 * into the SQL credential store so they show up as connected Data Sources.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: resolveCredential deliberately never reads process.env —
 * env vars are deploy-global and would leak across tenants in a hosted
 * multi-tenant app. This seeder is the explicit, gated escape hatch for
 * self-host / single-workspace / dev setups where the deployment's env vars
 * ARE the workspace's credentials.
 *
 * SAFETY:
 *  - Off unless ANALYTICS_SEED_ENV_CREDENTIALS=1 (or RUN_BACKGROUND_JOBS=1).
 *  - Only copies keys in the `credentialKeys` allowlist — never arbitrary env.
 *  - Never overwrites a credential already saved at the target scope, so manual
 *    Settings entries win.
 *  - Logs key NAMES only, never values.
 *
 * SCOPE TARGET:
 *  - ANALYTICS_SEED_CREDENTIALS_ORG_ID set  -> seed that org (whole workspace).
 *  - otherwise                              -> seed the user scope for
 *    ANALYTICS_SEED_CREDENTIALS_EMAIL (default dev@local.test, which is the
 *    identity AUTH_DISABLED runs every request as).
