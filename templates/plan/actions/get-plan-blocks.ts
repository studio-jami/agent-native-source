## Block headings

Blocks do not take a \`title\`. To give a block a heading, place a \`rich-text\` block whose markdown is a \`###\` (h3) heading directly above the block. Those headings are real, inline-editable, and appear in the document outline — unlike the legacy block \`title\` field, which renders as a small muted label and cannot be edited in place. This includes the bottom Open Questions form: put an \`### Open Questions\` heading above the \`question-form\` block rather than titling it. The \`title\` field still renders for older plans, but do not set it on new blocks.`;

/**
 * Authoritative authoring canon appended to the block catalog return value.
 * Lives here so the style rules are backed by the registry and apply to every
 * create/update action that defers to get-plan-blocks instead of repeating the
 * rules in per-action describe strings.

## Authoring rules

**Diagrams**: use \`diagram\` blocks with \`data.html\`/\`data.css\`. Use renderer-owned classes: \`.diagram-panel\`, \`.diagram-card\`, \`.diagram-node\`, \`.diagram-box\`, \`.diagram-pill\`, \`.diagram-muted\`, plus \`data-rough\`. Use \`--wf-*\` CSS tokens for color; never set custom fonts or hard-code hex/rgb/hsl values. Legacy nodes/edges only for tiny previews or true step-by-step flows. Use \`mermaid\` only when textual grammar is materially clearer than a spatial layout.

**Wireframes**: set \`data.html\` to a semantic HTML fragment; pick a surface (desktop/mobile/popover/panel/browser). The renderer owns theme, footprint/aspect, Excalifont, and rough.js sketch overlay. Use \`--wf-*\` CSS tokens for any custom color (never hex). Prototype screens use semantic HTML with \`data-goto\` attributes for navigation.

**Before/After columns**: for UI state comparisons, put one \`wireframe\` block in each side of a \`columns\` block and set the column labels to \`Before\` and \`After\`; the renderer draws labels as headings and lays narrow surfaces side by side. Never bake Before/After labels inside the wireframe HTML or hand-stack the pair.

**File maps**: prefer \`annotated-code\` blocks (real code + line-anchored notes) grouped in a vertical \`tabs\` block, one tab per key file. Drop to a plain \`code\` block only for throwaway snippets with nothing to call out.

**Tabs grouping**: use horizontal \`TabsBlock\` groups for multiple related diffs so each split diff gets full document width.

**API endpoints**: keep \`api-endpoint\` and \`openapi-spec\` blocks in normal single-column document flow. Use \`columns\` only for an explicit before/after contract comparison.

**renderMode**: leave unset or set to \`wireframe\` unless a design-only editable mock is required.\``;

/**
