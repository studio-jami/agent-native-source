# Assets — Agent Guide

Assets is an agent-native asset library and generation workspace. The agent
manages libraries, images, generated assets, inline embeds, notifications,
collaboration, and A2A asset requests through actions and SQL state.

Detailed library, generation, image, embed, and engine rules live in
`.agents/skills/`.

## Core Rules

- Use actions for asset lifecycle, generation, library organization, uploads,
  embeds, notifications, progress, sharing, and collaboration. Do not bypass
  access checks.
- Use the configured generation/engine path for image and asset work. Do not add
  ad hoc provider calls when the app has an action/engine abstraction.
- Preserve provenance and metadata for generated or imported assets.
- Use `view-screen` when the active library, selected asset, picker, generation,
  or embed target is unclear. The picker is also available from the left nav.
- Keep inline previews and picker outputs lightweight; fetch full asset details
  through actions when needed.
- Use framework sharing/collaboration primitives for ownable assets.

## Application State

- `navigation` exposes library, asset, generation, picker, embed, and selection
  context. Picker state includes media type, selected library, query, prompt, and
  aspect ratio when available.
- `navigate` moves the UI to picker, library, generation, asset, and settings
  surfaces.

## Skills

Read the relevant skill before deeper work:

- `library-management`, `asset-generation`, `image-generation`, and
  `agent-engines` for asset workflows.
- `inline-embeds`, `a2a-assets`, `notifications`, `progress`, and
  `real-time-collab` for integration surfaces.
- `actions`, `storing-data`, `security`, `frontend-design`, and `shadcn-ui` as
  needed.

## App-Backed Skill Distribution

- The preferred hosted install path is
  `npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add images` (or `assets`). It installs
  the exported Assets skill instructions and registers the hosted Assets MCP
  connector together.
- For human-in-the-loop image creation, call `open-asset-picker` with `prompt`,
  `autoGenerate: true`, and `count: 3` so the picker opens with candidates to
  preview, tweak by preset/aspect/count, and choose.
