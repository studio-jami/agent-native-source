# Builder Migration Target

## Rule

Use Builder for routes and content that benefit from visual management, while
keeping app logic, private workflows, actions, data, and auth in agent-native
code.

## How

- Classify landing, marketing, and docs routes as Builder-eligible by default.
- Keep API routes, authenticated app pages, jobs, database writes, and agent
  operations in the generated agent-native app.
- Preserve route ownership in the plan: Builder page/content model, generated
  React route, or manual mapping.
- Verify route parity, content model coverage, asset references, and fallback
  behavior before accepting.

## Don't

- Do not move secrets, server mutations, or user-scoped data access into Builder
  content.
- Do not mark a route Builder-ready without a documented fallback for dynamic or
  authenticated behavior.
