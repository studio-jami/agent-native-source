# Migration Workbench

## Rule

Treat every migration as a resumable goal with a source reference, a target, an
approved plan, bounded output writes, and verifier evidence.

## Workflow

1. Capture the source as a path, URL, or description. Local paths may be
   introspected directly; URLs and descriptions need an adapter-specific
   inventory before output work.
2. Create or select the run, then use `run-migration-goal` to advance safely.
3. Stop when approval is required. Never write generated output before
   `approved` is true.
4. After approval, run bounded sweeps and verification. Use the returned
   `criticDecision` to decide whether to retry, tune, ask for a manual decision,
   roll back generated output, or accept.
5. Reference artifacts under `data/migration-runs/<runId>/` for assessment,
   plan, tasks, verifier results, and the report.

## Actions

- `run-migration-goal`: preferred goal-driven advance action.
- `view-screen`: inspect the selected run and goal state.
- `navigate --runId <id>`: open a run in the Workbench UI.
