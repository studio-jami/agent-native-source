# AEM Migration Source

## Rule

Model AEM input as evidence from one or more modes: crawl, API, package, code,
or enterprise. Record gaps explicitly instead of pretending the inventory is
complete.

## Modes

- `crawl`: live URLs, sitemap, screenshots, SEO metadata, redirects.
- `api`: AEM GraphQL Content Fragments and DAM metadata.
- `package`: Vault/JCR content packages, pages, nodes, and assets.
- `code`: HTL components, dialogs, templates, policies, Sling models.
- `enterprise`: combine modes and emit confidence notes for missing mappings.

## How

- Use path, URL, and description together when available.
- Keep credentials out of artifacts and chat. Ask for configured secrets or
  authenticated connectors when protected AEM APIs are needed.
- Separate content modeling, component mapping, asset migration, redirects, and
  runtime behavior into verifier-backed tasks.
