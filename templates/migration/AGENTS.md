# {{APP_NAME}} — Agent Guide

This hidden app is the internal run detail/control surface for the Code Agents `/migrate` goal. Code Agents is the user-facing product; `/migrate` is a built-in goal; this app exists to assess sources, require approval, track tasks, expose artifacts, and verify generated output. A migration source can be a local path, a URL, or a human description; adapters turn that source evidence into an inventory before any output work begins. The source project must be read-only. Generated output goes to the run's `outputRoot`, usually a sibling folder such as `../migrated-app`.

## Core Rules

- Never mutate the source project.
- Do not write generated output until the run has an approved plan.
- Use actions for every operation the UI can perform.
- Keep run state in SQL and artifacts on disk under `data/migration-runs/<runId>/`.
- Treat verification as part of the `/migrate` goal: every migration claim needs a report or verifier result.

## Application State

| State Key    | Purpose                                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `navigation` | Current internal surface view, path, `?run=<id>`, and goal context |
| `navigate`   | One-shot command for the UI to open the internal run surface       |

The current screen state is auto-injected into chat. Use `view-screen` when you need a richer snapshot of the selected run, goal state, task list, and verifier results. Use `navigate --runId <id>` to open `/?run=<id>` in the internal run surface.

## Source Model

Treat source input abstractly:

- **Path** — a local immutable source such as a Next.js app root. V1 can introspect local Next.js paths directly.
- **URL** — a live site, sitemap, CMS endpoint, AEM endpoint, or crawl seed. Capture URL evidence and adapter mode before planning.
- **Description** — a human-entered brief for enterprise migrations where code, CMS, or credentials are incomplete. Convert it into explicit assumptions and manual mapping tasks.

Do not pretend a URL or description has the same confidence as a local source path. Record gaps in the plan and verifier report.

## /migrate Goal Flow

1. `create-migration-run` records path, URL, or description input plus output path. It does not write output.
2. `assess-migration` uses the first matching source adapter, or agent-introspection fallback, and writes `01-assessment.md`.
3. `generate-migration-plan` creates recipes/tasks and writes `02-plan.md` and `03-tasks.md`.
4. `approve-migration-plan` unlocks generated output writes.
5. `run-migration-task` performs the V1 sweep/scaffold step and marks task status.
6. `verify-migration` runs deterministic verifiers and writes `04-report.md`.

Prefer `run-migration-goal` for Code Agents goal-driven operation. It is idempotent and bounded: it safely performs missing assessment/planning, stops for approval before generated output writes, scaffolds once after approval, advances at most `maxTasks` pending tasks, verifies, persists verifier results/report paths, returns `criticDecision`, and tells you the next action.
