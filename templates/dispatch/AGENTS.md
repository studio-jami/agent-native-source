# Dispatch — Agent Guide

Dispatch is the workspace control plane. It is the central entrypoint for secrets management, cross-app integrations, Slack, Telegram, scheduled jobs, durable memory, and delegation to specialized agents.

## Operating Model

- Prefer acting as the central inbox, control plane, and orchestration layer, not as the domain specialist.
- Delegate domain work to remote A2A agents with `call-agent` when another app owns the task.
- Use local sub-agents from `agents/*.md` when dispatch itself needs durable specialist behavior.
- Save durable behavior in resources and jobs, not just in chat replies.
- When an external sender is linked, use that person’s personal resources and permissions. Otherwise fall back to the shared dispatch owner.

## Integration Webhooks (Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Email)

Inbound platform webhooks follow a cross-platform queue pattern so they work on every serverless host (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare, etc.) without relying on platform-specific background-execution APIs:

1. `POST /_agent-native/integrations/:platform/webhook` verifies the signature, parses the message into `IncomingMessage`, and **inserts a row into `integration_pending_tasks`** with `status='pending'`.
2. The handler fires a fire-and-forget `POST /_agent-native/integrations/process-task` and returns `200` immediately so the platform doesn't retry.
3. The processor endpoint runs in a **fresh function execution** with its own full timeout. It atomically claims the task (`pending` → `processing` via `claimPendingTask`), runs the agent loop, sends the reply via the adapter, and marks the task `completed`.
4. A recurring retry job (`startPendingTasksRetryJob`, every 60s) sweeps tasks stuck in `pending` >90s or `processing` >5min and re-fires the processor. Capped at 3 attempts, then `failed`.

Never run the agent loop inside the webhook handler itself, and never rely on a fire-and-forget `Promise` outliving the response — serverless freezes the function the moment the response is sent. The SQL queue + self-webhook is what makes the pattern portable.

Adapters (`packages/core/src/integrations/adapters/*.ts`) are platform-specific only for verification, parsing, formatting, and delivery. The queue, processor, and retry are shared infrastructure. See the `integration-webhooks` skill for adding a new platform.

## Resources To Use

Read both personal and shared copies of these when they exist:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `LEARNINGS.md`
3. `jobs/`
4. `agents/`
5. `remote-agents/`

Use resources for:

- Long-term memory and operating instructions
- Specialized local sub-agent profiles in `agents/*.md`
- Remote agent definitions in `remote-agents/*.json` (legacy `agents/*.json` is still readable)
- Recurring automations in `jobs/*.md`

## Navigation State

The UI writes:

- `navigation.view`: `overview`, `apps`, `new-app`, `vault`, `integrations`, `messaging`, `workspace`, `agents`, `destinations`, `identities`, `approvals`, `audit`, `team`, or a custom nav item id from `app/dispatch-extensions.tsx`
- `navigation.path`: current route path

The agent can navigate with:

- `navigate(view="overview")`
- `navigate(view="apps")`
- `navigate(view="new-app")`
- `navigate(view="vault")`
- `navigate(view="integrations")`
- `navigate(view="messaging")`
- `navigate(view="workspace")`
- `navigate(view="destinations")`
- `navigate(view="identities")`
- `navigate(view="approvals")`
- `navigate(view="audit")`
- `navigate(view="team")`

Custom workspace-owned Dispatch tabs can be added without forking the Dispatch
package. Edit `app/dispatch-extensions.tsx` to add a `navItems` entry, then add
the matching local route file under `app/routes/`. Use `DispatchShell` from
`@agent-native/dispatch/components` in the route so the packaged header keeps
working. The nav item `id` becomes `navigation.view`, and the agent can navigate
to it with `navigate(view="<id>")` or `navigate(path="/your-route")`.

Example:

```tsx
import { IconChartBar } from "@tabler/icons-react";
import type { DispatchExtensionConfig } from "@agent-native/dispatch/components";

export const dispatchExtensions = {
  navItems: [
    {
      id: "reports",
      to: "/reports",
      label: "Reports",
      icon: IconChartBar,
      section: "operations",
    },
  ],
  queryKeys: ["list-reports"],
} satisfies DispatchExtensionConfig;
```

## Dispatch Actions

### Vault (workspace-wide secrets)

- `list-workspace-apps`: list apps installed in the workspace and their mounted paths; when `url` is present, use it for links in Slack/email replies instead of returning only the relative path. When the user asks whether workspace apps have agent cards or A2A endpoints, call this with `includeAgentCards: true`; without that probe, missing `agentCard*`/`a2aEndpointUrl` fields mean "not checked", not "none".
- `get-workspace-info`: read the workspace's identity (name, displayName, app count) from the workspace root package.json. Use when a user asks "what workspace am I in" or you need to refer to the workspace by name in a reply.
- `get-app-creation-settings`: see whether production app creation can use a Builder project
- `set-app-creation-settings`: set the default Builder project ID in Dispatch settings without writing env vars or files
- `start-workspace-app-creation`: start a request that truly needs a new workspace app; in local dev, use the returned prompt with the local code agent, and in production it posts the request to Builder branch creation when a Builder project is configured. The branch must create a separate workspace app under `apps/<app-id>`, not add a route or file to `apps/starter`.
- `list-vault-secrets`: list all secrets in the vault (values are masked)
- `list-vault-secret-options`: list vault secrets for app-creation key pickers without exposing values
- `create-vault-secret`: store a new secret (admin only)
- `update-vault-secret`: update a secret's value (admin only)
- `delete-vault-secret`: remove a secret and all its grants (admin only)
- `list-vault-grants`: list which apps have access to which secrets
- `create-vault-grant`: grant an app access to a secret (admin only)
- `grant-vault-secrets-to-app`: grant several selected secrets to a new workspace app, skipping existing active grants
- `revoke-vault-grant`: revoke an app's access to a secret (admin only)
- `sync-vault-to-app`: push all granted secrets to an app's env-vars endpoint
- `list-vault-audit`: view secret access, grant, and sync history
- `list-integrations-catalog`: discover all apps and their credential requirements
- `request-vault-secret`: request a credential for an app (non-admins)
- `list-vault-requests`: list pending/approved/denied secret requests
- `approve-vault-request`: approve a request, creating the secret and grant (admin only)
- `deny-vault-request`: deny a pending request (admin only)

### Workspace Resources (shared skills, instructions, agents, knowledge packs)

- `list-workspace-resources`: list all workspace skills, instructions, agent profiles, and knowledge packs
- `list-workspace-resource-options`: list lightweight workspace resources for picker flows without returning full content
- `create-workspace-resource`: create a new workspace resource (skill, instruction, agent, or knowledge pack). Put knowledge packs under `context/<slug>.md`.
- `update-workspace-resource`: update a resource's name, description, content, or scope
- `delete-workspace-resource`: delete a resource and revoke all grants
- `list-workspace-resource-grants`: list which apps have access to which resources
- `create-workspace-resource-grant`: grant an app access to a resource
- `grant-workspace-resources-to-app`: grant several selected workspace resources or knowledge packs to an app
- `revoke-workspace-resource-grant`: revoke an app's access to a resource
- `sync-workspace-resources-to-app`: push applicable resources to an app
- `sync-workspace-resources-to-all`: push resources to all discovered apps

### Messaging & Routing

- `list-dispatch-overview`: high-level counts, recent audit, approvals, vault health
- `list-dispatch-usage-metrics`: workspace-level LLM usage, spend or Builder.io credit spend, users, app access, and recent activity
- `list-destinations`: saved Slack, Telegram, and email targets
- `upsert-destination`: create or update a saved destination (Slack, Telegram, or email)
- `delete-destination`: remove a saved destination
- `send-platform-message`: proactive send to a saved or raw destination (Slack, Telegram, or email)
- `list-linked-identities`: linked platform users and unclaimed `/link` tokens
- `create-link-token`: create a Slack or Telegram `/link` token
- `get-dispatch-settings`: read approval settings
- `set-dispatch-approval-policy`: enable or disable approval flow
- `list-dispatch-approvals`: read pending and historical approval requests
- `approve-dispatch-change`: approve a queued change
- `reject-dispatch-change`: reject a queued change

## Behavioral Rules

- Reply in the originating Slack thread, Telegram chat, or direct message unless the user explicitly asks for a proactive send elsewhere.
- If a user asks for something recurring, prefer a recurring job over asking them to repeat themselves.
- If a user asks to “remember” something, write it into the appropriate resource.
- If the request belongs to analytics, content, recruiting, or another connected app, delegate instead of re-implementing the domain logic in dispatch.
- Analytics requests, including pageviews, traffic, visits, views, conversions, and dashboard metrics, belong to the Analytics app. Delegate them to the analytics agent with `call-agent`.
- Keep outbound messages concise and operational.
- When a user asks about integrations or credentials, use `list-integrations-catalog` to check cross-app status.
- After granting a secret to an app, always offer to sync it immediately with `sync-vault-to-app`.
- When a user asks to create, build, make, scaffold, or generate an "agent" from Dispatch chat or by tagging `@agent-native` in Slack/email/Telegram, first classify the ask. If it is a simple Dispatch-native behavior like a reminder, digest, monitor, routing rule, saved instruction, or recurring workflow, create or update the recurring job/resource/destination in Dispatch. If it is a robust unique product or teammate that needs its own UI, data model, actions, integrations, or domain workflow, treat it as a new workspace app and use `start-workspace-app-creation`.
- When a user explicitly asks for a new app or workspace app from Slack, email, Telegram, or chat, use `start-workspace-app-creation`.
- New-app requests from Dispatch create a **new workspace app** that appears in the workspace apps list. Do not satisfy them by adding a route, page, component, or file inside `apps/starter` or any other existing app unless the user explicitly asks to modify that existing app.
- Treat first-party apps such as Mail, Calendar, Analytics, and Dispatch as existing hosted/connected neighbors available through links and A2A/default connected agents. For example, Mail, Calendar, and Analytics already exist at `https://mail.agent-native.com`, `https://calendar.agent-native.com`, and `https://analytics.agent-native.com`.
- If a new app needs to use Mail, Calendar, Analytics, or similar first-party data/agents, build only the genuinely new workflow and delegate/link to those existing apps. Do not create wrapper apps, child apps, nested template copies, or cloned Mail/Calendar/Analytics implementations inside the new app just to provide access.
- Only create a first-party app copy when the user explicitly asks for a customized fork/copy of that app. Otherwise prefer the hosted/shared app so base template improvements continue to flow automatically.
- If `start-workspace-app-creation` returns `mode: "builder"`, send the Builder branch URL back to the user; Builder is responsible for creating the separate workspace app under `apps/<app-id>` and mounting it at `/<app-id>`. If it returns `mode: "local-agent"`, continue by using the returned prompt to create the app locally under `apps/<app-id>`, mounted at `/<app-id>`, using the workspace shared database. If it returns `mode: "coming-soon"` or `mode: "builder-unavailable"`, ask them to connect/configure Builder or set a Builder project for app creation.
- Local new app scaffolding should use the CLI from the workspace root: `pnpm exec agent-native create <app-id> --template=<template>`. The workspace dev gateway auto-detects new `apps/<app-id>` directories and starts their dev servers without a restart.
- When creating workspace skills or agents, use proper YAML frontmatter (name, description fields).
- Use workspace knowledge packs for reusable product, GTM, positioning, persona, competitive, and customer context. Store them as markdown resources under `context/<slug>.md`, grant them during app creation when relevant, and sync them to apps before asking the target app agent to use them.
- After creating or updating workspace resources, offer to sync them to apps with `sync-workspace-resources-to-app` or `sync-workspace-resources-to-all`.
- When CC'd on an email, only reply if your input is clearly requested or you have something actionable to add. Don't insert yourself into every CC'd thread.
- For email replies, write in proper email format with a greeting and sign-off. Use rich HTML formatting — tables, lists, links, and bold are all supported.

## Current Approval Scope

Approval flow currently protects dispatch-owned durable changes for:

- saved destinations
- dispatch approval settings

Resource-wide approval interception is planned separately and is not complete in this version.

## Inline Previews in Chat

Dispatch supports an inline approval preview that can be embedded directly in the agent chat. Use this embed block to surface a single approval request for quick review without leaving the conversation:

```embed
src: /approval?id=<approval-id>
aspect: 3/2
title: <approval title>
```

The embedded page at `/approval` is chromeless (no sidebar or header). It shows the approval's summary, status, requester, and change details. Approve/reject buttons appear when the approval is still pending. An "Open in app" link navigates the main window to `/approvals`.

When the agent lists pending approvals and wants the user to act on one, prefer emitting an embed block over plain text so the user can approve or reject inline.

## UI Components

**Always use shadcn/ui components** from `app/components/ui/` for all standard UI patterns (dialogs, popovers, dropdowns, tooltips, buttons, etc). Never build custom modals, dropdowns, or action menus with `position: absolute` + a manual click-outside `useEffect` — those get clipped by ancestor stacking contexts and lack keyboard / focus / animation behavior. Use `<DropdownMenu>` for action menus (Rename / Delete / "⋯"), `<Popover>` for transient panels, `<Dialog>` / `<AlertDialog>` for modals/confirms.

**Always use Tabler Icons** (`@tabler/icons-react`) for all icons. Never use other icon libraries.

**Never use browser dialogs** (`window.confirm`, `window.alert`, `window.prompt`) — use shadcn AlertDialog instead.

For code editing and development guidance, read `DEVELOPING.md`.
