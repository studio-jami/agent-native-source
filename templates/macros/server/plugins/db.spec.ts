 * column shipped without a matching migration, which silently 500s every
 * read/write touching a pre-existing production table because
 * `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is a no-op once the table already exists).
 *
 * This walks every Drizzle table exported from schema.ts and asserts every

 * (db.ts) — either in the table's original `CREATE TABLE` or in a later
