# @agent-native/toolkit

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 277d115: Ship a `@agent-native/toolkit/styles.css` entrypoint that registers the package's
  compiled components with Tailwind via a self-relative `@source` directive. Apps
  that render toolkit UI should `@import "@agent-native/toolkit/styles.css";` in
  their `app/global.css` (after the core stylesheet).

  Without it, Tailwind never generated classes that appear only inside toolkit
  components — e.g. the dropdown/popover content's `z-[250]` and enter/exit
  animations — so those components rendered with no `z-index` (drawing behind app
  panels) and looked broken/invisible even though they were mounted. This mirrors
  how `@agent-native/core` self-registers its client styles.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b24446e: Add `@agent-native/toolkit` for reusable app-building UI, move shared template primitives into it, and keep core UI shim imports working through compatibility re-exports.
