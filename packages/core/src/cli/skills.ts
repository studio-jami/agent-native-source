  agent-native skills add assets|design-exploration|plans|visual-plan|ui-plan|visualize-plan|context-xray [--client codex|claude-code|claude-code-cli|cowork|all] [--scope user|project] [--mcp-url <url>] [--yes] [--dry-run] [--json]
  agent-native skills add <manifest-or-app-dir> [--client ...] [--yes]

Examples:
  agent-native skills add assets
  agent-native skills add design-exploration
  agent-native skills add plans
  agent-native skills add context-xray --client all
  agent-native skills add assets --client claude-code
  agent-native skills add assets --mcp-url https://my-app.ngrok-free.dev
  agent-native skills add ./dist/assets-skill --client codex

The add command wraps the Vercel Labs/open skills CLI for SKILL.md
installation, then registers the app-backed MCP connector. Running
"npx skills add ..." directly installs instructions only; use this Agent Native
CLI path when you want MCP setup too. Pass --mcp-url to register that connector
against a custom origin (an ngrok tunnel, a local dev server, or a self-hosted
deployment) instead of the built-in hosted default — a bare origin gets the
standard /_agent-native/mcp path appended. Use app-skill pack for marketplace
bundles and custom adapter output.`;

  Use Assets for image or video generation requests, brand-safe media,
  human picker UI, search/list/export actions, and cross-app asset selection.
  Prefer this over generic image tools when installed.
metadata:
  visibility: exported
---

# Assets

Use the Assets app when a workflow needs reusable brand media, a human picker,
or generated image/video assets that another app can reference by ID and URL.
When this skill is available, route plain image-generation requests here instead
of using a generic image generator.

## Choose The Path

- Use \`open-asset-picker\` when a person should browse, search, generate, and
  select an asset in UI. Pass \`mediaType: "image"\` by default, or
  \`mediaType: "video"\` for video libraries. When the user asks to create a
  specific image and choose the best option, pass \`prompt\`,
  \`autoGenerate: true\`, and \`count: 3\` so the picker opens with candidates
  to preview and select.
- Use unattended actions when the agent already knows what to do:
  \`search-assets\`, \`list-assets\`, \`generate-image\`,
  \`generate-image-batch\`, \`generate-video\`,
  \`refresh-generation-run\`, and \`export-asset\`.
- Use browser/deep-link fallback when the host cannot render MCP Apps inline.
  Surface the returned picker link. If it opens in a normal browser tab, have
  the user select an asset there and paste back the copied handoff summary.
  Treat Codex, Claude Code, and Claude Desktop Code as link-out hosts; do not
  promise inline MCP App rendering there.
  If the skill instructions are available but the MCP tool namespace has not
  appeared yet, use the Assets browser fallback URL shape instead of switching
  to a generic generator:
  \`https://assets.agent-native.com/library?mediaType=image&prompt=...&autoGenerate=1&count=3\`.
  When reporting the final selected image in Codex or Claude Code, include the
  asset link and, if an inline preview is important, download the selected
  \`previewUrl\`/\`downloadUrl\` to a local temp image and embed that absolute
  local path. Remote CDN markdown images can fail to render in code-editor chat
  surfaces.

## Image And Video Workflows

1. Pick or match the library with \`list-libraries\` or \`match-library\`.
2. For images, call \`generate-image\` or \`generate-image-batch\`. Image
   actions are synchronous: one batch call should return the finished image
   candidates, so do not poll or regenerate unless a returned slot failed.
3. For videos, call \`generate-video\` and poll \`refresh-generation-run\`
   until the run completes.
4. Preserve returned \`assetId\`, \`runId\`, \`previewUrl\`, \`downloadUrl\`,
   media type, and dimensions so the caller can attach or embed the result.

## Cross-App Use

- Hosted default: connect \`https://assets.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp\`.
  Do not put shared secrets in skill files.
- For CLI/code-editor clients, keep any \`agent-native connect\` command
  running until browser authorization finishes. Stopping it early can leave the
  browser approved but the local MCP config unwritten. Restart or reload the
  agent client after installing or connecting if Assets tools do not appear in
  the live session.
- Local customization: use \`agent-native app-skill launch --local\` from an
  Assets app-skill manifest, or pass \`--into <path>\` for editable source.
- Do not call image/video providers directly from another app. Assets owns
  generation, picker UI, search/list/export, and asset context.
- If an Assets tool call returns \`Session terminated\`, \`needs auth\`, or
  another connector/session error, do not keep retrying the tool. Tell the user
  to reconnect or authenticate the Assets MCP connector, then continue after it
  is available.
- Do not hand-roll MCP HTTP requests with curl from the agent session. Use the
  host-exposed Assets tools after restart/reload, or use the returned
  browser/deep-link fallback.
- If a batch image generation request times out in browser fallback, retry with
  \`count: 1\` only after telling the user the multi-candidate request timed out.
- If you inspect local MCP config, redact \`Authorization\`, \`http_headers\`,
  and token values. Never paste bearer tokens into chat or logs.

  Use Design for UI/UX exploration, side-by-side design directions,
  interactive prototype previews, user selection, iteration, and design-to-code
  handoff through the hosted Design MCP app.
metadata:
  visibility: exported
---

# Design Exploration

Use the Design app when a workflow needs visual UI exploration, prototype
iteration, or a human-in-the-loop choice among design directions.

## Choose The Path

- Use \`create-design\` first to create a project shell. Do not report the
  design as ready until it has renderable HTML.
- For open-ended UX exploration, generate distinct, complete HTML directions
  (2-5, three by default) and call \`present-design-variants\`. The inline
  Design MCP app shows the options, lets the user pick one, and persists the
  selected variant.
- If the Design app opens as a browser link instead of inline (CLI hosts like
  Codex / Claude Code, where the deep link carries \`handoff=chat\`), the user
  picks a direction there and the editor shows a copyable summary — ask them to
  paste it back into chat so you can continue from the chosen direction. The
  \`present-design-variants\` result's \`fallbackInstructions\` describe this.
- For direct refinements to an already chosen direction, call
  \`get-design-snapshot\`, edit from the current tuned HTML, then call
  \`generate-design\`.
- Use \`export-coding-handoff\` when the user wants to implement the chosen
  design in a codebase.

## Exploration Defaults

1. Default to three variants unless the user asks for a different count
   (\`present-design-variants\` accepts 2-5; three is the sweet spot).
2. Make variants structurally and stylistically distinct, not just color swaps.
3. Each variant must be a complete standalone HTML document that renders
   without a build step.
4. For product UI redesigns, prefer cleaner hierarchy, progressive disclosure,
   and realistic controls over decorative mockups.
5. After \`present-design-variants\`, wait for the user's pick before
   generating the next version. If they say "I like #2 but...", snapshot the
   chosen design and refine that direction with \`generate-design\`.

## Cross-App Use

- Hosted default: connect \`https://design.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp\`.
  Do not put shared secrets in skill files.
- For CLI/code-editor clients, keep any \`agent-native connect\` command
  running until browser authorization finishes. Stopping it early can leave the
  browser approved but the local MCP config unwritten. Restart or reload the
  agent client after installing or connecting if Design tools do not appear in
  the live session.
- Dispatch can expose Design alongside other apps. Use Design for UI/UX design
  tasks, Assets for image/media selection, Slides for decks, and so on.
- Keep the loop visual: surface the inline MCP App or the returned "Open
  design" link instead of pasting large HTML blobs into chat.
- If a Design tool call returns \`Session terminated\`, \`needs auth\`, or
  another connector/session error, do not keep retrying the tool. Tell the user
  to reconnect or authenticate the Design MCP connector, then continue after it
  is available.
- Do not hand-roll MCP HTTP requests with curl from the agent session. Use the
  host-exposed Design tools after restart/reload, or use the returned
  browser/deep-link fallback.
- If you inspect local MCP config, redact \`Authorization\`, \`http_headers\`,
  and token values. Never paste bearer tokens into chat or logs.

  Use Agent-Native Plans when coding-agent work needs an interactive HTML plan
  document with diagrams, wireframes, mockups, prototypes, annotations, and
  comments.
metadata:
  visibility: exported
---

# Agent-Native Plans

Agent-Native Plans is HTML plan mode for coding agents. Generate the kind of
plan you would normally write in Markdown, but as a scannable HTML plan
document with visual blocks mixed in: diagrams, wireframes, mockups, prototype
options, tradeoff cards, file/symbol implementation maps, code previews, and
annotation prompts. It is a plan document, not a marketing page.

The goal is impatient review. The user should be able to react to visuals first
and read prose only where it helps.

Install with the Agent-Native CLI. It adds the skills and the MCP connector:

\`\`\`bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add plans
\`\`\`

Then start typing \`/visual-plan\` for a fresh general plan, \`/ui-plan\` for a
UI-first high-fidelity plan, or \`/visualize-plan\` to turn an existing Codex,
Claude Code, Markdown, or pasted plan into a visual companion. The hosted MCP
app opens inline where supported and falls back to a browser link everywhere
else.

## Slash Commands

- \`/visual-plan\`: create a fresh rich HTML plan before implementation. Include
  a docs-level plan, visual architecture/flow diagrams, detailed wireframes or
  mockups when UI is involved, an implementation map with files/symbols/snippets,
  tradeoffs, open questions, and clear feedback prompts.
- \`/ui-plan\`: create a UI-first high-fidelity HTML plan before implementation.
  Use an optional top pan/zoom wireframe or diagram canvas when visuals clarify
  the flow, then continue as a refined Notion-like document with rich tabs,
  comments/drawing prompts, code tabs, and agent handoff notes.
- \`/visualize-plan\`: import an existing Codex, Claude Code, Markdown, or pasted
  text plan and turn it into a visual companion. Preserve the plan's intent,
  then add diagrams, wireframes, option cards, file/symbol maps, and annotation
  prompts.

## When To Use

Create or update a visual plan when:

- the user asks for a plan, visual plan, HTML plan, plannotate-style review,
  diagrams, wireframes, mockups, prototype options, comments, or annotations;
- work is multi-file, ambiguous, long-running, risky, or UI-heavy;
- the user needs to react quickly to direction rather than read prose;
- architecture, data flow, UI direction, options, or open questions would be
  clearer visually;
- you need the user to react before implementation.

The companion \`visualize-plan\` skill is installed with this one. Use it when
the user already has a Codex, Claude Code, Markdown, or pasted text plan and
wants a visual companion instead of a fresh plan.

## Core Workflow

1. Call \`create-visual-plan\` with the title, brief, source, repo path, and plan
   sections before implementation.
2. Put the best possible plan document in \`html\` when you can. It should feel
   like a bespoke HTML version of a strong Markdown implementation plan, not a
   dashboard or landing page.
3. Surface the returned Plans link or inline MCP App. In CLI hosts, ask the user
   to review the plan visually.
4. Prefer diagrams, wireframes, UI mockups, option cards, implementation maps,
   and small interactive prototypes over paragraphs.
5. Call \`get-plan-feedback\` before editing, after review, after any long pause,
   and before the final response.
6. Incorporate comments/corrections with \`update-visual-plan\`; update the HTML
   document when feedback changes the direction.
7. Export an HTML/JSON/Markdown receipt with \`export-visual-plan\` when the
   user wants a shareable summary.

## Visual Defaults

- Use implementation-plan structure first: objective, scope/non-goals, proposed
  approach, phases or steps, files/symbols/snippets, risks, open questions, and
  validation.
- UI work gets detailed wireframes, mockups, or prototype options before coding.
- Use \`/ui-plan\` when UI direction is the center of the work. \`/visual-plan\`
  stays the general plan command for architecture, backend, refactors, and
  mixed implementation planning.
- Wireframes should be concrete enough to critique: layout regions, controls,
  states, empty/loading/error paths, review affordances, and copy placeholders.
- Backend/refactor work gets architecture and data-flow diagrams.
- Complex tradeoffs get two or three option cards with consequences.
- Open questions are surfaced as visual callouts, not buried in paragraphs.
- Long prose is split into readable document sections with clear headings.
- Visuals should be review aids, not decoration. Avoid decorative hero art,
  gradient/hero backgrounds, brand/logo chrome, nav bars, slogans, fluffy value
  props, huge landing-page H1s, or marketing-style cards unless the user
  explicitly asks.
- Implementation plans include a file map: file path, symbols/components to
  touch, reason for the change, risk/coordination notes when relevant, and short
  syntax-highlighted snippets for the code shape the agent expects to modify.
- File previews should be concise and reviewable. Do not paste entire large
  files; show the key region, public API, component boundary, schema, action, or
  selector that matters for review.
- Include README-like detail when helpful: command names, tool behavior,
  install flow, MCP/link fallback, data shape, and what is in or out of scope.
- Comments, corrections, replacements, and annotations should feel
  plannotator-style: fast to mark up, structured enough for the agent to
  consume, and easy to share when the user chooses.

## Tool Guidance

- \`create-visual-plan\`: start one HTML plan per agent task/run.
- \`create-ui-plan\`: start a UI-first plan with high-fidelity screen/state tabs.
- \`visualize-plan\`: create a visual companion from an existing text plan.
- \`update-visual-plan\`: revise the plan document, sections, status, or comments.
- \`get-visual-plan\`: read the current plan document and annotations.
- \`get-plan-feedback\`: read unconsumed human feedback. Use it frequently.
- \`export-visual-plan\`: export HTML, Markdown fallback, and structured JSON.

## HTML Guidance

- Prefer semantic HTML with scoped CSS inside the document.
- Match Agent-Native's dark, restrained theme unless the user asks otherwise.
- Keep the first viewport legible and plan-like: title, brief, concise scope,
  and a useful diagram/checklist/table when it helps.
- Use tabs, accordions, or small interactions only when they make review faster.
- Do not paste huge HTML into chat. Store it in Plans and surface the MCP app or
  link.

## Guardrails

- Keep it simple. Do not build a ten-tab dashboard unless the user asks.
- Do not hand-roll MCP HTTP requests with curl. Use host-exposed tools after
  restart/reload, or use the returned browser/deep-link fallback.
- Hosted default: connect
  \`https://plan.agent-native.com/_agent-native/mcp\`. Do not put shared
  secrets in skill files.

  wireframe canvas, a refined Notion-like document, rich tabs, diagrams,
  comments, drawing, and agent handoff.
metadata:

# UI Plan

Use \`/ui-plan\` when the task is primarily about product UI, user flows,
interaction states, component layout, responsive behavior, or visual direction.
This is a specialized Agent-Native Plans workflow: the reviewable UI comes
first, and implementation details come after the user has something concrete to
react to.

\`/visual-plan\` remains the general rich planning command for architecture,
backend, refactors, migrations, and mixed work. Use \`/visualize-plan\` when a
text plan already exists and should become an HTML companion.

## UI-First Workflow

1. Call \`create-ui-plan\` with a UI-specific title, brief, source, repo path,
   and a complete bespoke \`html\` document whenever possible.
2. When the plan has meaningful UI flows, screens, or diagrams, make the top
   of the document a bounded pan/zoom sketch canvas with the key artboards,
   connectors, margin notes, and commentable visual anchors.
3. Continue below the canvas as a restrained, Notion-like interactive document:
   clear prose, horizontal state tabs, inline wireframes, sketchy diagrams,
   tables, vertical code tabs, and concise implementation notes.
4. Skip the top canvas when wireframes or diagrams would not clarify the work;
   in that case, keep the plan as a clean rich document.
5. Put files, symbols, data/actions, migrations, risks, and validation lower in
   the document after the visual review area.
6. Call \`get-plan-feedback\` before implementation, after review, after a long
   pause, and before the final response. Apply changes with
   \`update-visual-plan\`.

## Mockup Quality Bar

- Build high-fidelity screen sections with realistic spacing, controls,
  hierarchy, text, and state-specific content. Avoid vague gray boxes.
- Show the actual workflow the user will use: navigation, toolbar actions,
  forms, dialogs, empty states, error recovery, loading affordances, and
  confirmation/success states.
- Include desktop and mobile/responsive states when layout decisions could
  change. Put them in tabs or adjacent panels rather than burying them in prose.
- Use concrete labels and copy placeholders that expose content length,
  truncation, disabled states, and destructive actions.
- Make state tabs span the plan content width. Small cards are fine for repeated
  items, but the primary UI preview should not be trapped in a tiny thumbnail.
- Keep visuals review-focused, not decorative. Do not make a marketing page,
  hero section, brand deck, or abstract mood board unless the user asks.

## State Tabs

When showing multiple UI states, use the Plans tab attributes so the iframe
runtime wires up the interaction:

- Put \`data-plan-tabs\` on the tab group.
- Put \`data-tab-target\` on each tab button.
- Put matching \`data-tab-panel\` values on panels.

Good state tab sets include:

- \`Default\`, \`Loading\`, \`Empty\`, \`Error\`
- \`List\`, \`Detail\`, \`Edit\`, \`Confirm\`
- \`Desktop\`, \`Tablet\`, \`Mobile\`
- \`Owner\`, \`Reviewer\`, \`Signed out\`

## UI Flow Document

Generated \`/ui-plan\` documents use one default shape: an optional Figma-style
pan/zoom visual preface followed by a refined Notion-like document. There is no
mode boolean. Provide \`states\` and \`components\` when the top canvas will help
the reviewer understand the flow; omit them when the plan should be
document-only. You may pass \`sketchiness\` from \`0\` to \`100\`; omit it for the
default hand-drawn strength.

The document below the canvas should still include the same planning substance:
screen states, component notes, implementation map, review prompts, comments,
drawing-friendly space, and agent handoff. Treat it like a designer handed over
a Figma file plus a crisp product spec: the reviewer should understand the UI
flow from a bird's-eye view, then keep scrolling into a clean interactive
document with notes explaining how the screens work together.

## Comments, Drawing, And Handoff

- Add visible annotation prompts beside the mockups: "Comment on layout",
  "Circle unclear copy", "Mark missing state", or "Pick this option".
- Leave enough whitespace around key UI regions for drawing and callouts.
- Label important regions so comments can reference them without ambiguity.
- Include an "Agent Handoff" section after the mockups that summarizes the
  chosen UI direction, unresolved visual questions, and feedback that must be
  read before code changes.
- Never claim feedback has been applied until \`get-plan-feedback\` or the user
  has supplied the feedback in chat.

## Implementation Details Lower Down

After the visual canvas and document review blocks, include a concise
implementation section:

- file paths and symbols/components to touch;
- data/actions/hooks/routes needed for the UI;
- state ownership, optimistic updates, and sync expectations;
- accessibility, responsive, and keyboard considerations;
- test and verification plan;
- short code-shape snippets only where they clarify the implementation.

Do not paste whole files or let implementation prose crowd out the mockups.
The purpose of \`/ui-plan\` is to get visual direction approved before the agent
starts editing.

## Tool Guidance

- \`create-ui-plan\`: create the UI-first HTML plan.
- \`update-visual-plan\`: revise mockups, state tabs, comments, or handoff notes.
- \`get-visual-plan\`: inspect the current plan and annotations.
- \`get-plan-feedback\`: read unconsumed reviewer comments before coding.
- \`export-visual-plan\`: export a review receipt when needed.

  Convert an existing Codex, Claude Code, Markdown, or pasted plan into a
  Agent-Native Plans HTML companion with diagrams, wireframes, annotations, and
  feedback.
metadata:
  visibility: exported
---

# Visualize Plan

Use this as the visual companion for an existing text plan. The native Codex or
Claude Code plan can stay exactly where it is; Agent-Native Plans turns it into
an interactive HTML review surface with diagrams, wireframes, prototype options,
annotations, questions, and feedback.

This is for impatient review. Default to things the user can scan and react to.
It should still read like a plan, not a marketing page.

Install with the Agent-Native CLI if Plans is not already available:

\`\`\`bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest skills add plans
\`\`\`

That installs \`/visual-plan\`, \`/ui-plan\`, and \`/visualize-plan\` plus the
MCP connector.

## When To Use

Use \`visualize-plan\` when:

- the user has an existing Codex, Claude Code, Markdown, or pasted plan;
- the user asks to visualize, annotate, plannotate, mock up, diagram, or make a
  plan easier to review;
- the plan is long enough that the user may not read it closely;
- UI direction, architecture, data flow, risky assumptions, or open questions
  would be clearer visually;
- the user wants feedback on wireframes, design/prototype options, diagrams, or
  tradeoffs before implementation.

If there is no existing plan text available, ask for it, use \`visual-plans\`
to create a fresh general plan, or use \`ui-plan\` when the work is UI-heavy and
should start with high-fidelity state mockups.

## Workflow

1. Gather the existing plan text from the user's paste, a referenced file, or
   the recent agent-visible plan. Do not invent a source plan.
2. Call \`visualize-plan\` with \`planText\`, \`title\`, \`goal\`, \`source\`,
   and \`repoPath\` when available.
3. Surface the returned Plans link or inline MCP App.
4. Enrich the imported plan with \`update-visual-plan\` when helpful:
   - diagrams for architecture, data flow, state machines, or dependencies;
   - detailed wireframes/mockups for user-visible UI changes, including layout,
     controls, states, empty/loading/error paths, and copy placeholders;
   - two or three option cards when there are real tradeoffs;
   - small prototype sketches for interactions, states, or animation choices;
   - reviewable assumptions and open questions;
5. Ask the user to react in the visual plan. Then call \`get-plan-feedback\`
   before implementing, after review, and before final response.
6. Treat the imported text as source material. Structured Plans state is
   canonical for feedback, assumptions, and decisions.

If there is no existing plan text and the work is UI-heavy, use \`/ui-plan\`
instead so full-width state mockups, comments/drawing affordances, and agent
handoff come before file implementation details.

## Visual Defaults

- Keep the first screen simple and plan-like: title, brief, concise scope, and
  one useful diagram/checklist/table when it helps.
- Prefer one strong diagram or wireframe over a wall of sections.
- Preserve the source plan's implementation substance: phases or steps,
  files/symbols/snippets, risks, open questions, and validation.
- Hide long prose behind disclosure controls or source references when it helps
  review speed.
- Add README-like detail when the source is too terse: slash commands, tool
  behavior, install flow, MCP/link fallback, data shape, and scope.
- Avoid decorative hero art, gradient/hero backgrounds, logos, nav bars,
  slogans, fluffy value props, huge landing-page H1s, and marketing-style cards
  unless the user explicitly asks.
- Visuals should be review aids, not decoration.
- Label inferred items as possible, not confirmed.
- Ask for feedback with targeted prompts: "Which option?", "Is this flow
  right?", "What assumption is wrong?", "What should change?"
- Preserve native-agent momentum: this companion should make the plan easier to
  approve or revise, not force a giant planning ceremony.

## Guardrails

- Do not replace a native plan unless the user asks. Build beside it.
- Do not pretend the companion has feedback until \`get-plan-feedback\` returns
  it or the user pastes it back.
- Do not use visual polish as a substitute for clarity. The point is review.
- Do not hand-roll MCP HTTP requests with curl. Use host-exposed tools after
  restart/reload, or use the returned browser/deep-link fallback.
