/**
 * Security response headers middleware.
 *
 * Sets a baseline set of "no-brainer" security headers on every framework HTTP
 * response. These headers are layered defenses: each one mitigates a specific
 * class of attack, and together they harden the surface against MIME-sniffing,
 * referrer leakage, mixed-content downgrades, and cross-origin window/embed
 * access.
 *
 * The headers we emit:
 *
 *   - `Strict-Transport-Security` — forces HTTPS for the browser's lifetime
 *     of the cached value, preventing SSL-strip MITM. Only emitted when the
 *     request scheme is `https` (we don't want to break local-dev HTTP, and
 *     emitting HSTS over HTTP is a no-op per the spec but causes confusion).
 *   - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` — disables browser MIME sniffing so
 *     a tool /render route serving user-authored HTML can't be misinterpreted
 *     as some other content type by a clever Accept header.
 *   - `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` — strips path/query
 *     from outbound Referer headers when the request crosses origin, so a
 *     public-share viewer's outbound link clicks never leak the share token.
 *   - `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(self), geolocation=(),
 *     screen-wake-lock=()` — allows the app shell to request microphone access
 *     for composer dictation while keeping camera/location/wake-lock blocked
 *     by default. Templates that need broader media capture for recording UI
 *     override this on their own routes.
 *   - `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` — isolates window.opener so
 *     a popup-window opener reference can't read or modify our document.
 *   - `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` — emitted only for
 *     validated MCP embed-session page loads and browser iframe navigations.
 *     COEP hosts such as Claude's MCP Apps proxy require framed cross-origin
 *     documents to opt in explicitly.
 *   - `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-site` — prevents other origins from
 *     embedding our endpoints as `<img>` / `<script>` / `<audio>`, blocking
 *     the simplest data-leak chain when combined with auth cookies. Validated
 *     MCP embed-session page loads and browser iframe navigations use
 *     `cross-origin` so COEP hosts can frame app documents.
 *
 * NOTE: `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` is NOT set by default because it
 * requires every embedded subresource to opt in via CORP/CORS, which would
 * break Builder's iframe editor and template embed use cases. COOP + CORP
 * without COEP gives us most of the protection on normal responses; COEP is
 * only added for validated MCP embed-session page loads and browser iframe
 * navigations (see above).
 *
 * NOTE: `X-Frame-Options` is intentionally not set globally. Agent-native apps
 * are expected to run inside iframe hosts such as Builder, Design, and MCP app
 * shells. Routes that render especially sensitive iframe-only documents should
 * set their own route-specific CSP / frame policy.
