/**
 * Durable background agent-chat runs (Netlify background functions).
 *
 * Off by default. When enabled, a long in-app agent-chat turn is dispatched
 * into a Netlify *background* function (15-min budget) instead of completing
 * synchronously under the ~40s soft-timeout. The foreground POST claims the
 * run slot, inserts the run row, fires an HMAC-signed self-dispatch to
 * `AGENT_CHAT_PROCESS_RUN_PATH`, and returns the existing SSE subscription so
 * the client streams the same events (via the cross-isolate SQL-poll path)
 * with no client change.
 *
 * This module owns ONLY the gating decision + shared constants so both the
 * HTTP handler (`production-agent.ts`) and the processor route
 * (`agent-chat-plugin.ts`) agree on when the path is active without a circular
 * import. The actual run machinery is reused verbatim from run-manager /
 * run-store / self-dispatch / internal-token.
 *
 * GUARDRAIL: when `isAgentChatDurableBackgroundEnabled()` returns false, the
 * agent-chat handler must behave byte-for-byte like the current synchronous
 * path. The gate is true only when ALL of these hold:
 *   1. `AGENT_CHAT_DURABLE_BACKGROUND` env is not explicitly disabled. It is
 *      DEFAULT-ON: unset/empty/unknown counts as enabled; set it to a falsy
 *      value (`false`/`0`/`no`/`off`) to opt a specific app back out.
 *   2. The runtime is hosted/serverless (local dev keeps the inline path so SSE
 *      stays a single live stream and no second function is needed).
 *   3. `A2A_SECRET` is configured (the HMAC handoff is required to authenticate
 *      the background dispatch; without it the dispatch can't be trusted).
 *
 * Default-on is safe because a *dispatch failure degrades to an inline run*: if
 * the self-dispatch self-POST can't be delivered (fast connection error or
 * fast non-2xx), the foreground handler runs the turn synchronously instead of
 * erroring (see `production-agent.ts` — the inline fallback claims the run row
 * atomically so a delayed delivery can never double-execute). So an app where
 * durable dispatch happens to fail still gets a working chat, just without the
 * 15-min budget.

 * `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME` to the function's name, so a `-background` suffix is
 * the runtime proof that the ~60s synchronous wall does NOT apply here.
 *
 * This is the SAFETY GUARD for the soft-timeout regime. The `_process-run`
 * self-dispatch worker (`isBackgroundWorker`) is NOT enough on its own: if the
 * `-background` function was never emitted (deploy gate off, or Netlify routed
 * the path to the synchronous function), the self-POST lands on the regular
 * ~60s `server` function. A worker there MUST use the 40s soft-timeout and
 * checkpoint before the 60s wall — using the ~13min budget would overshoot the
 * hard wall and get killed at 60s, then re-dispatch/resume in a wasteful loop.
 * So the 13-min budget is taken ONLY when this returns true.
 *

 * for hosts that don't expose a `-background`-suffixed function name but where
