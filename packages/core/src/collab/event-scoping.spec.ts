/**
 * Unit tests for collab event access scoping.
 *
 * Verifies that the canSeeChangeForUser logic correctly prevents collab
 * updates (tagged with owner/orgId) from being delivered to users who
 * lack access, while still delivering them to the correct users.
 *
 * This tests the security contract set up by the security commit: collab
 * events are tagged with owner/orgId when resourceType is configured, so
 * getChangesSinceForUser scopes delivery.
