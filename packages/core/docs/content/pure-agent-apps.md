# Pure-Agent Apps

A pure-agent app is the minimal end of agent-native: the app-agent loop is the
product, not a dashboard. You send a request from the terminal, Slack, email, a
scheduled job, another agent, or Chat — "summarize my unread emails," "post the
daily metrics to Slack" — and the agent acts and returns the result wherever it
belongs. It is still a real app: actions, sessions, app state, history,
settings, credentials, and share records all live in SQL.

```an-diagram title="The app-agent loop is the front door" summary="Many entry points reach one agent loop over SQL-backed actions and state; results return to wherever the request came from. UI is added only when humans need to supervise."

  "html": "<div class=\"diagram-pure\"><div class=\"diagram-col\"><div class=\"diagram-pill\">Terminal</div><div class=\"diagram-pill\">Slack · email</div><div class=\"diagram-pill\">Scheduled job</div><div class=\"diagram-pill\">Another agent (A2A)</div><div class=\"diagram-pill\">Chat</div></div><div class=\"diagram-arrow diagram-muted\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&rarr;</div><div class=\"diagram-panel center\" data-rough><span class=\"diagram-pill accent\">App-agent loop</span><small class=\"diagram-muted\">actions · sessions · app state in SQL</small></div><div class=\"diagram-arrow diagram-muted\" aria-hidden=\"true\">&rarr;</div><div class=\"diagram-box\" data-rough>Result returns<br><small class=\"diagram-muted\">to where it belongs</small></div></div>",

}
```

Reach for this shape when the work runs in the background, the output leaves the
app, the domain is one-shot, or you're prototyping. The agent still needs a UI —
not a dashboard, but a place for humans to supervise, configure, and steer it —
which is why even pure-agent apps usually mount the built-in Chat shell.

This is the **headless** product shape. The full decision guide, what ships in
the box, the scaffold, repo access, and run sharing now live in one place:
