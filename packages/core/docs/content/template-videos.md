# Video

A programmatic video studio for the kind of motion graphics, product demos, and kinetic-text videos that are a pain to keyframe by hand. Ask the agent for "a 6-second logo reveal that fades in at 2 seconds" and it builds the animation. Tune timing, easing, and camera moves on a timeline, then render to MP4 or WebM.

```an-wireframe
{
  "surface": "desktop",
  "html": "<div style='display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:12px;padding:16px;min-height:530px;box-sizing:border-box'><div style='display:flex;align-items:center;gap:10px'><h1 style='margin:0'>Logo reveal</h1><span class='wf-pill accent'>6 seconds</span><div style='flex:1'></div><button>Preview</button><button class='primary'>Render</button></div><div class='wf-card' style='flex:1;display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;min-height:250px'><div style='text-align:center'><strong>Remotion preview</strong><br/><small class='wf-muted'>logo scales in as the title fades</small></div></div><div class='wf-card' style='display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:10px'><div style='display:flex;gap:8px;align-items:center'><span class='wf-pill'>0s</span><span class='wf-pill'>2s</span><span class='wf-pill'>4s</span><span class='wf-pill'>6s</span><div style='flex:1'></div><button>New track</button></div><div class='wf-box'>Title fade · 0-48 frames</div><div class='wf-box'>Logo scale · 48-120 frames</div><div class='wf-box'>Camera push · 72-144 frames</div></div></div>"
}
```

When you open the studio, you'll see a list of compositions on the home screen. Click into one and you get a player on top, a timeline at the bottom, and a properties panel on the right. The agent always knows which composition you have open.

```an-diagram title="Animation as data" summary="A composition is a React component; every animation reads from a track so the agent and the timeline edit the same data."

}
```

## What you can do with it

- **Generate animations from a prompt.** "Add a title card that fades in at 2 seconds and holds until 5." The agent edits the composition.
- **Tune timing on a timeline.** Drag and resize animation tracks, scrub through frames, set easing curves visually.
- **Animate the camera.** Pan, zoom, and tilt with on-screen tools. Click the tool, drag in the preview, and a keyframe is auto-created.
- **Start from a blank composition or an example.** The template ships one in-code composition (`BlankComposition`) to start from; example compositions — kinetic text, logo reveals, particle bursts, interactive UI demos, slideshows — load from the database, and you can add your own.
- **Edit easing curves visually.** 30+ curves shipped — power, back, bounce, circ, elastic, expo, sine, plus spring physics.
- **Render to MP4 or WebM** at 1x, 2x, or 3x supersampling for crisp text and vectors during camera zoom.

This is more of a developer-flavored tool than other templates — compositions are React components, so power users (or the agent) can write whole new animation types from scratch. But everyday tweaks ("make the typing slower," "drop the particle count to 12") are just chat.

## Getting started

Live demo: [videos.agent-native.com](https://videos.agent-native.com).

When you open the studio:

1. Pick a composition from the home screen.
2. Try the agent: "add a logo reveal that fades in at 2 seconds." Watch the timeline update.
3. Drag tracks to retime, click the camera tool, scrub the player.

### Useful prompts

- "Add a title card that fades in at 2 seconds and holds until 5."
- "Change the camera to zoom 2x on the logo between frames 60 and 90."
- "Make the typing reveal slower — 40% longer."
- "The particle burst is too dense. Drop the count to 12."
- "Create a new composition called intro-loop, 1080x1080, 6 seconds."
- "Add a click animation on the button zone and animate the cursor to it."
- "Give this track a spring easing instead of ease-out."

If you select a track in the timeline and hit Cmd+I, the agent picks up that selection — "make this one snappier" just works.

## For developers

The rest of this doc is for anyone forking the Video template or extending it. This template is more code-forward than the others — every composition is a React component and every animation is data on a track.

### Architecture

Everything you see in the studio is code. A composition is a `CompositionEntry` in `app/remotion/registry.ts` that points at a React component in `app/remotion/compositions/`. Every animation in that component reads from an `AnimationTrack` so users can drag, resize, and retime it in the timeline UI. The agent can create new compositions, add tracks, tune easing, and write whole React components that plug into the registry.

The studio runs on Remotion's `<Player>` for preview and the Remotion CLI for final render. Output defaults to 1920x1080 at 30fps.

### Quick start

Scaffold a new Video app from the CLI:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest create my-video-app --standalone --template videos
cd my-video-app
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open the studio in your browser, create a composition, and start from blank. Ask the agent something like "add a logo reveal that fades in at 2 seconds" and it will edit the composition for you.

### Key features

**React-based compositions.** Videos are Remotion-backed React components, with SQL-backed user compositions and an optional code registry for local defaults.

**Timeline-first animation.** Duration tracks, keyframes, easing curves, camera moves, and programmatic expression tracks all edit the same composition data.

**Adjustable motion systems.** Parameters, cursor tracks, interactive hover zones, range navigation, and repeat playback make generated animations tunable without code.

**Render and persistence.** Composition settings, quality, fps, track values, and overrides persist per composition and render to MP4 or WebM through Remotion.

### Working with the agent

The agent always knows which composition you have open. Navigation state (`{ view, compositionId }`) is written to the framework's `application_state` table, and the `view-screen` action returns it plus a hint pointing at `app/remotion/registry.ts`. You don't have to tell the agent which composition you're on — ask it to act on "this one" and it will.

Under the hood the agent calls actions like `navigate`, `save-composition`, and `generate-animated-component`. SQL-backed composition records are created or updated through `save-composition`; code-backed Remotion components still live in `app/remotion/compositions/*.tsx` and are registered in `app/remotion/registry.ts`.

### Data model

Server-side schema is in `templates/videos/server/db/schema.ts`:

```an-schema title="Video data model" summary="SQL-backed compositions plus design systems and nestable folders, each with a framework shares table."
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "id": "compositions",
      "name": "compositions",
      "note": "User-created compositions and overrides; ownableColumns",
      "fields": [
        { "name": "id", "type": "text", "pk": true },
        { "name": "title", "type": "text" },
        { "name": "type", "type": "text" },
        { "name": "data", "type": "text", "note": "Full composition JSON blob" },
        { "name": "created_at", "type": "text" },
        { "name": "updated_at", "type": "text" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "design_systems",
      "name": "design_systems",
      "note": "Reusable brand tokens; ownableColumns",
      "fields": [
        { "name": "data", "type": "text", "note": "colors / typography / spacing" },
        { "name": "assets", "type": "text", "nullable": true },
        { "name": "custom_instructions", "type": "text", "nullable": true },
        { "name": "is_default", "type": "boolean" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "folders",
      "name": "folders",
      "note": "Nestable folders; ownableColumns",
      "fields": [
        { "name": "id", "type": "text", "pk": true },
        { "name": "name", "type": "text" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "folder_memberships",
      "name": "folder_memberships",
      "note": "Many-to-many join",
      "fields": [
        { "name": "folder_id", "type": "text", "fk": "folders.id" },
        { "name": "composition_id", "type": "text", "fk": "compositions.id" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "relations": [
    { "from": "folders", "to": "folder_memberships", "kind": "1-n", "label": "members" },
    { "from": "compositions", "to": "folder_memberships", "kind": "1-n", "label": "in folders" }
  ]
}
```

Each table also has a matching framework shares table (`composition_shares`, `design_system_shares`, `folder_shares`) produced by `createSharesTable()`.

- `compositions` — id, title, type, `data` (full composition JSON blob), ownership columns, timestamps.
- `composition_shares` — standard share grants produced by `createSharesTable()`.
- `design_systems` — reusable brand tokens (colors, typography, spacing, assets, custom instructions, `is_default` flag) with `ownableColumns`.
- `design_system_shares` — share grants for design systems.
- `folders` — nestable folders for library organization, with `ownableColumns`.
- `folder_shares` — share grants for folders.
- `folder_memberships` — many-to-many join between a `folder_id` and a `composition_id`.

### Folders and design systems

Compositions can be organized into folders and styled with design systems. Actions: `create-folder`, `rename-folder`, `delete-folder`, `move-composition-to-folder`. Design system actions: `create-design-system`, `update-design-system`, `get-design-system`, `list-design-systems`, `set-default-design-system`, `apply-design-system`, `analyze-brand-assets`. Import actions: `import-github`, `import-from-url`, `import-document` (DOCX/PPTX/PDF).

The registry in `app/remotion/registry.ts` is the in-code source of truth for what ships with the template. The SQL table stores user-created compositions and overrides. Studio state (per-composition track edits, prop overrides, composition settings) is mirrored to `localStorage` under `videos-tracks:<id>`, `videos-props:<id>`, and `videos-comp-settings:<id>`, and deep-merged back onto the registry defaults on load.

Core TypeScript shapes (`app/types.ts`):

- `AnimationTrack` — `id`, `label`, `startFrame`, `endFrame`, `easing`, `animatedProps[]`.
- `AnimatedProp` — `property`, `from`, `to`, `unit`, plus optional `keyframes`, `programmatic`, `description`, `codeSnippet`, `parameters`, `parameterValues`.
- `CompositionEntry` — `id`, `title`, `description`, `component`, `durationInFrames`, `fps`, `width`, `height`, `defaultProps`, `tracks`.

Compositions are private by default. Visibility can be `private`, `org`, or `public`, and share grants give `viewer`, `editor`, or `admin` roles — wired through the framework's sharing primitive.

### Customizing it

The template folder is `templates/videos/` (the user-facing slug is `video`, but the folder is plural).

**Actions** — `templates/videos/actions/`

- `view-screen.ts` — returns current navigation state for the agent.
- `navigate.ts` — navigate to a composition (`--compositionId <id>`) or the home view (`--view home`).
- `save-composition.ts` — create or update a SQL-backed composition record.
- `generate-animated-component.ts` — generate a new Remotion component file with boilerplate.
- `validate-compositions.ts` — check all registered compositions for structural problems.
- `list-compositions.ts`, `get-composition.ts`, `update-composition.ts`, `delete-composition.ts` — read, update, and delete SQL-backed composition records.

**Routes** — `templates/videos/app/routes/`

- `_index.tsx` — studio home; renders the shell and composition list.
- `c.$compositionId.tsx` — composition editor (timeline, player, properties panel).
- `components.tsx` — component library browser.
- `team.tsx` — team management.

**Remotion internals** — `templates/videos/app/remotion/`

- `registry.ts` — the authoritative composition list.
- `compositions/` — one `.tsx` per composition, plus an `index.ts` barrel.
- `trackAnimation.ts` — `trackProgress`, `getPropValue`, `findTrack`, `getPropValueKeyframed`.
- `CameraHost.tsx` — wraps composition content with the camera transform.
- `hooks/`, `ui-components/`, `components/` — interactive element helpers, cursor rendering, animated element wrappers.

**Studio UI** — `templates/videos/app/components/`

- `Timeline.tsx` — the fully-controlled timeline (`viewStart` / `viewEnd` own no state internally).
- `VideoPlayer.tsx` — Remotion `<Player>` wrapper with range-constrained playback.
- `TrackPropertiesPanel.tsx`, `CompSettingsEditor.tsx`, `PropsEditor.tsx` — the right-side panels.
- `CameraToolbar.tsx`, `CameraControls.tsx` — camera tools and numeric controls.

**Agent instructions** — `templates/videos/AGENTS.md` is the long-form guide the agent reads. It covers the animation-as-track rule, camera system, cursor system, CSS filter units, interactive component registration, UI spacing, and checklists for creating or editing compositions.

**Skills** — `templates/videos/.agents/skills/`

- `composition-management/SKILL.md` — how to create and register compositions.
- `animation-tracks/SKILL.md` — how to edit tracks and animated props.
- Plus the standard framework skills: `actions`, `self-modifying-code`, `delegate-to-agent`, `storing-data`, `security`, `frontend-design`, `create-skill`, `capture-learnings`.

To add a new composition, follow the checklist in `AGENTS.md`: create the component, declare `FALLBACK_TRACKS`, use `findTrack` / `trackProgress` / `getPropValue` (never hardcode frames), export from `compositions/index.ts`, add a `CompositionEntry` to the registry, and run `pnpm typecheck`.
