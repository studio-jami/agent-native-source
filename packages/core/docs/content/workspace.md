# Workspace

> **Which workspace doc?** This page covers the **customization layer** — what a workspace _is_. For the deployment shape (one monorepo, many apps) see [Multi-App Workspaces](/docs/multi-app-workspace); for governance (who reviews, approves, and owns what) see [Workspace Governance](/docs/workspace-management).

Every agent-native app ships with a **workspace**: the customization layer that makes the agent yours. It contains team instructions (`AGENTS.md`), shared learnings (`LEARNINGS.md`), personal structured memory (`memory/MEMORY.md`), skills the agent pulls in on demand, custom sub-agents, scheduled jobs, and connected MCP servers — everything you'd expect from a Claude Code / Codex setup.

The twist: **it's SQL rows, not filesystem files.** Each user gets their own workspace stored in the database. There's no dev-box to spin up, no container per user, no files to mount. A multi-tenant SaaS can give every user a fully-customizable agent for essentially free, because all of it is rows — personal memory, personal MCP servers, personal skills, personal sub-agents — and the shared codebase hosts all of them at once.

| Claude Code / Codex              | Agent-native workspace                             |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Files on your local disk         | Rows in a shared SQL database                      |
| One codebase per developer       | One codebase, many users                           |
| Needs a dev-box or container     | Runs on any serverless/edge host                   |
| Customization at `~/.claude/`    | Customization per-user, scoped `u:<email>:…`       |
| Per-project `CLAUDE.md` / skills | Per-app `AGENTS.md` + workspace memory resources   |
| MCP config in a JSON file        | MCP config in JSON _or_ the settings UI, per scope |

Same capabilities. Different economics. See [Templates](/docs/cloneable-saas) for why this matters for SaaS.

## Overview {#overview}

Resources have three runtime scopes:

- **Personal** — scoped to a single user (their email). Good for preferences, notes, and per-user context.
- **Shared / organization** — visible to all users in the app or organization. Good for app/team instructions, skills, and shared config.
- **Workspace** — inherited global defaults managed from Dispatch Resources. Good for company facts, positioning, brand guidelines, global guardrails, workspace-wide skills, and shared MCP servers. Apps read these at runtime; they are not copied into each app.

The in-app Workspace panel shows all three scopes. Personal and shared/organization resources are editable there. Workspace-scope resources are read-only in app panels and edited centrally from Dispatch, so every app sees the same canonical files without a sync step.

The canonical paths that control how the agent uses each resource:

| Runtime resource        | Path                                    | How agents use it                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Guardrail instructions  | `AGENTS.md` or `instructions/<slug>.md` | Loaded every turn in every app that receives it |
| Global skills           | `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`                | Listed as workspace skills and read on demand   |
| Brand/company resources | `context/<slug>.md`                     | Indexed every turn, read when relevant          |
| Custom agent profiles   | `agents/<slug>.md`                      | Available as reusable local agent profiles      |
| Shared HTTP MCP servers | `mcp-servers/<slug>.json`               | Loaded into granted apps' MCP tool registry     |

These paths apply across all three scopes — workspace, organization/app, and personal. The later scope wins when the same path exists at multiple levels.

## Getting Started: a 1-minute walkthrough {#getting-started}

Change how the agent behaves, in 60 seconds.

1. Open the **Workspace** tab → **Shared** → `AGENTS.md` (create it with `+` → **File** if missing).
2. Add one rule, e.g.:

   ```markdown
   ## Tone

   Be concise. Lead with the answer.
   ```

3. Save, switch to **Chat**, ask anything — the agent follows the new rule immediately.

**Next steps, when you want them:**

- **Skills** (`+` → **Skill**) — focused how-to files invoked in chat with `/skill-name`.
- **Agents** (`+` → **Agent**) — reusable sub-agent personas invoked with `@agent-name`.
- **Scheduled Tasks** (`+` → **Scheduled Task**) — prompts that run on a cron. See [Recurring Jobs](/docs/recurring-jobs) for schedules and triggers.
- **Memory** — shared `LEARNINGS.md` and personal `memory/MEMORY.md` keep durable context available across conversations.

## Global resources and canonical paths {#global-resources}

Workspace-scope resources are managed from Dispatch's **Resources** page and inherited by apps at runtime — no copy or sync step. Dispatch supports two grant scopes:

- **All apps** — global resources every app in the workspace inherits. Most company, brand, persona, positioning, messaging, and guardrail context should be **All apps**.
- **Selected apps** — resources granted to specific apps for app-specific context or tools. Use these sparingly.

The path determines how the agent uses a resource (see the table in [Overview](#overview) above). This is the right home for core personas, positioning, messaging, company facts, brand guidelines, support policies, shared skills, or shared HTTP MCP tools that many apps should benefit from.

A useful starter pack for a new workspace:

```text
context/company.md              # what the company does, ICP, products, links
context/brand.md                # voice, visual identity, spelling, forbidden usage
context/messaging.md            # positioning, value props, proof points, objections
instructions/guardrails.md      # compliance, escalation, and approval rules
skills/company-voice/SKILL.md   # on-demand guidance for customer-facing writing
agents/<slug>.md                # reusable custom agent profiles
```

Keep `context/` files factual and easy to skim. Put rules that must apply every turn in `instructions/guardrails.md`. Use `skills/company-voice/SKILL.md` when the agent should deliberately transform or review copy in the company's voice.

To override a global default for one app or team, create a shared/organization resource in that app with the same path. To override it for one person, create a personal resource with the same path. Do not copy the workspace file into every app; the runtime resolves the stack on read:

```text
workspace context/brand.md
-> shared/app context/brand.md
-> personal context/brand.md
```

Keep `context/` files short and factual — a few bullets the agent can skim:

```text
<!-- context/brand.md -->

# Brand

- Voice: direct, warm, concrete
- Use: "workspace", "agent", "team"
- Avoid: unsupported superlatives and vague AI claims
```

## Workspace Panel {#workspace-panel}

The agent panel includes a **Workspace** tab alongside Chat and CLI. It shows a folder-organized tree of all resources, an inline editor for any text file (Markdown, JSON, YAML, plain text), and the `+` menu's typed creation flows (Files, Skills, Agents, Scheduled Tasks). Users can browse inherited workspace defaults and create/edit/delete personal or organization resources.

When you open a resource, the editor shows an **Effective context** strip with the `workspace default -> organization/app override -> personal override` stack, so you can see what was inherited and why an override is active. Dispatch shows the same model from the control-plane side: on the **Resources** page use **Effective in app**, or expand **Stack** on a resource row in an app card's **Context** dialog.

When Dispatch approval policy is enabled, creating, updating, or deleting an **All apps** resource queues an approval request instead of applying immediately. The create/edit/delete dialogs show an impact preview before save.

## How the Agent Uses Resources {#how-the-agent-uses-resources}

The built-in app agent manages resources with the unified `resources` tool: use `action: "list"`, `"read"`, `"effective"`, `"write"`, `"promote"`, or `"delete"`. External CLI/code agents can use the equivalent `pnpm action resource-*` commands.

At the start of every conversation, the agent automatically reads:

### AGENTS.md and instructions {#agents-md}

`AGENTS.md` is an instruction resource seeded by default and loaded every turn from workspace, shared/organization, and personal scopes in that order — workspace for company-wide defaults, shared/app for team rules, personal for per-user preferences. Files under `instructions/` are separate guardrail documents that also apply every turn (compliance rules, escalation policy, brand voice) and follow the same precedence. Both normal chat and integration-triggered runs load them before responding.

```text
AGENTS.md
instructions/customer-support-guardrails.md
instructions/legal-review-policy.md
```

### Reference resources {#reference-resources}

Reusable company context lives under `context/` (personas, positioning, product facts, brand guidelines, competitive notes). The agent sees an index of these and reads the relevant file with the `resources` tool (`action: "read"`) when a task may depend on it; use `action: "effective"` to see whether a workspace default is overridden for an app or user.

### Memory {#memory}

The workspace has two current memory surfaces:

- `LEARNINGS.md` in **Shared** scope for project-wide conventions, corrections, and durable team knowledge.
- `memory/MEMORY.md` in **Personal** scope for structured memory about the current user.

The resource system also seeds a personal `LEARNINGS.md` for compatibility with older workspaces, but the chat preload path is shared `LEARNINGS.md` plus personal `memory/MEMORY.md`.

**What gets saved.** When you correct the agent ("always use X instead of Y"), share a preference ("I prefer concise answers"), or reveal context ("my team calls this 'the dispatch layer'"), the agent captures that learning so it doesn't repeat the mistake or re-ask. Project-wide learnings go in shared `LEARNINGS.md`; user-specific memory goes under `memory/`. The `capture-learnings` skill spells out when and how.

**Where it fits.**

| Surface            | Scope              | Written by                           | Read when                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `AGENTS.md`        | Shared             | Humans / agent on request            | Every turn                             |
| `LEARNINGS.md`     | Shared             | Humans / agent on request            | Every turn (shared copy only)          |
| `memory/MEMORY.md` | Personal           | Agent / humans                       | Every turn                             |
| `instructions/…`   | Shared             | Humans / agent on request            | Every turn                             |
| `skills/…`         | Shared             | Humans / agent on request            | On demand (`/slash` command)           |
| `context/…`        | Shared             | Humans / agent on request            | Indexed every turn, read when relevant |
| `mcp-servers/…`    | Workspace / shared | Humans via Dispatch or app workspace | MCP config refresh                     |

Users can edit these memory files directly in the Workspace tab — they're regular resources. Delete lines the agent got wrong, keep personal preferences in `memory/MEMORY.md`, or promote team-wide rules into `AGENTS.md`.

## Skills {#skills}

Skills are Markdown resource files under the `skills/` path (preferably `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`) that give the agent on-demand domain knowledge, invoked in chat with `/skill-name`. Add them from the Workspace tab or, in Code mode, from `.agents/skills/`.

See the [Skills Guide](/docs/skills-guide) — the single source for skill format, scope, discovery, and authoring.

## Custom Agents {#custom-agents}

Custom agents are reusable local sub-agent profiles stored as Markdown resources under `agents/*.md`. This is the canonical home for the custom-agent format.

Use them when you want a focused delegate with its own name, description, model preference, and instruction set. Unlike skills, custom agents are not passive guidance — they are operational personas the main agent can invoke through `@` mentions or by selecting them during sub-agent spawning.

### Agent format {#agent-format}

Custom agents use YAML frontmatter plus Markdown instructions:

```markdown
---
name: Design
description: >-
  Reviews layouts, interaction patterns, and product UX decisions.
model: inherit
tools: inherit
delegate-default: false
---

# Role

You are a focused design agent.

## Responsibilities

- Review layouts and interaction flows
- Suggest stronger visual direction
- Be concise and opinionated
```

Recommended conventions:

- Store custom agents at `agents/<slug>.md`
- Use `model: inherit` unless the profile clearly needs a different model
- Keep `tools: inherit` for now; the field is reserved for future tool policies

### Remote agents vs custom agents {#remote-vs-custom-agents}

There are two agent types in Workspace:

- **Custom agents** — local profiles in `agents/*.md`, executed inside the current app/runtime
- **Connected agents** — remote A2A peers described by manifests in `remote-agents/*.json` (legacy `agents/*.json` manifests are still recognized)

Use custom agents for delegation within one app. Use connected agents when you need to call another app over A2A.

## @ Tagging {#at-tagging}

Type `@` in the chat input to reference workspace items. A dropdown appears at the cursor showing matching agents and files. Use arrow keys to navigate and Enter to select. The selected item appears as an inline chip in the input.

When you send a message, **files/resources** are passed as references the agent can read, **custom agents** run locally with their profile instructions, and **connected agents** are called over A2A.

## / Slash Commands {#slash-commands}

Type `/` at the start of a line to invoke a skill. A dropdown shows available skills with their names and descriptions; selecting one adds an inline chip and includes its content as context when the message is sent. If no skills are configured, the dropdown links to these docs.

## Code vs App Mode {#dev-vs-prod}

The resource system works identically in both modes. What differs is the additional sources available for `@` tagging and `/` commands:

| Feature            | Code Mode                                                               | App Mode                                               |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| @ tagging          | Codebase files + workspace resources + custom agents + connected agents | Workspace resources + custom agents + connected agents |
| / slash commands   | .agents/skills/ + resource skills                                       | Resource skills only                                   |
| Agent file access  | Filesystem + resources                                                  | Resources only                                         |
| Workspace panel    | Full access                                                             | Full access                                            |
| AGENTS.md / memory | Available                                                               | Available                                              |

## Workspace Connections {#workspace-connections}

Workspace Connections let apps share the same provider account (Slack, GitHub, HubSpot, etc.) without duplicating credentials. A connection records provider identity, account labels, status, scopes, app grants, and credential references in SQL. Secrets stay in the credential store; connections only point at credential key names such as `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`.

See [Workspace Connections](/docs/workspace-connections) for the quickstart, connection/grant/credentialRef API, and concrete Slack, HubSpot, and GitHub examples.

## Resource API {#resource-api}

Resources can be managed from server code, actions, or the REST API.

### Server API {#server-api}

REST endpoints mounted automatically:

| Method   | Endpoint                                      | Description                          |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `GET`    | `/_agent-native/resources?scope=all`          | List resources                       |
| `GET`    | `/_agent-native/resources?scope=workspace`    | List inherited workspace resources   |
| `GET`    | `/_agent-native/resources/tree?scope=all`     | Get folder tree                      |
| `GET`    | `/_agent-native/resources/effective?path=...` | Show the effective inheritance stack |
| `POST`   | `/_agent-native/resources`                    | Create a resource                    |
| `GET`    | `/_agent-native/resources/:id`                | Get resource with content            |
| `PUT`    | `/_agent-native/resources/:id`                | Update a resource                    |
| `DELETE` | `/_agent-native/resources/:id`                | Delete a resource                    |
| `POST`   | `/_agent-native/resources/upload`             | Upload a file as resource            |

### Action API {#script-api}

The agent uses these built-in actions. You can also call them from your own actions:

```bash
# List all resources
pnpm action resource-list --scope all

# Read a resource
pnpm action resource-read --path "skills/my-skill/SKILL.md"

# Read inherited workspace context managed by Dispatch
pnpm action resource-read --scope workspace --path "context/brand.md"

# Show workspace -> organization/app -> personal precedence for a path
pnpm action resource-effective --path "context/brand.md"

# Write a resource
pnpm action resource-write --path "notes/meeting.md" --content "# Meeting Notes..."

# Delete a resource
pnpm action resource-delete --path "notes/old.md"
```
