# Analytics Tracking

One function, multiple destinations. Call `track()` from any server-side code — actions, plugins, server routes — and the event fans out to every registered analytics provider. No SDK dependencies, no client-side scripts, no blocking. The same `track()` is also available in [browser/app code](#client) and routes to the same providers.

This is _product_ analytics — your app's events flowing to PostHog/Mixpanel/Amplitude. For _agent quality_ metrics (traces, cost, evals, feedback) stored in your own database, see [Observability](/docs/observability).

```ts
import { track } from "@agent-native/core/tracking";

track(
  "order.completed",
  { total: 49.99, items: 3 },
  { userId: "steve@builder.io" },
);
```

## Built-in providers {#built-in}

Set an env var and the provider auto-registers at server startup. No code changes required.

| Provider  | Env vars                                                                                        |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PostHog   | `POSTHOG_API_KEY` (required), `POSTHOG_HOST` (optional, defaults to `https://us.i.posthog.com`) |
| Mixpanel  | `MIXPANEL_TOKEN`                                                                                |
| Amplitude | `AMPLITUDE_API_KEY`                                                                             |
| Webhook   | `TRACKING_WEBHOOK_URL` (required), `TRACKING_WEBHOOK_AUTH` (optional `Authorization` header)    |

Multiple providers can be active simultaneously. Every event goes to all of them.

## API {#api}

### `track(name, properties?, meta?)` {#track}

Fire an analytics event. Fans out to all registered providers.

```ts
import { track } from "@agent-native/core/tracking";

track(
  "meal.logged",
  { mealName: "Salad", calories: 350 },
  { userId: "steve@builder.io" },
);
```

### `identify(userId, traits?)` {#identify}

Identify a user with traits. Forwarded to providers that support it (PostHog, Mixpanel, Amplitude, webhook).

```ts
import { identify } from "@agent-native/core/tracking";

identify("steve@builder.io", { plan: "pro", company: "Builder.io" });
```

Need a custom backend, the provider-registry API, or the batching/singleton internals? See [Advanced: custom providers & internals](#advanced) at the end.

## Using track() in templates {#templates}

Call `track()` from action handlers to record user or agent activity:

```ts
// actions/create-project.ts
import { defineAction } from "@agent-native/core/action";
import { track } from "@agent-native/core/tracking";
import { z } from "zod";

export default defineAction({
  description: "Create a new project.",
  schema: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    template: z.string().optional(),
  }),
  run: async ({ name, template }, ctx) => {
    const project = await db
      .insert(projects)
      .values({ name, template })
      .returning();

    track("project.created", { name, template }, { userId: ctx.userEmail });

    return { ok: true, projectId: project[0].id };
  },
});
```

Track calls are fire-and-forget — they return immediately and never block the action response.

## Client-side tracking {#client}

`track()` also works from browser/app code. Import the client twin from `@agent-native/core/client` and call it the same way — it POSTs the event to the framework route at `POST /_agent-native/track`, which forwards it to the **same** registered server-side providers (PostHog, Mixpanel, Amplitude, webhook). No analytics SDK ships to the browser and no provider keys are exposed client-side.

```ts
import { track } from "@agent-native/core/client";

// e.g. inside a click handler or effect
track("checkout.completed", { total: 49.99, items: 3 });
```

Key differences from the [server `track()`](#track):

- **No identity argument.** The event is attributed server-side to the signed-in user (and the active org, as `org_id` in `properties`). Browser code never passes a `userId`.
- **`source: "client"`** is added to every event's properties so you can tell client-originated events apart from server ones.
- **Fire-and-forget.** It never blocks the UI, never throws, and swallows network errors.
- **Authenticated, first-party only.** The route requires a session and a same-origin/CSRF marker (set automatically by the helper), so it can't be used as an open analytics relay. `name` is capped at 200 characters and `properties` at ~16KB; oversized or malformed payloads are rejected.

This is distinct from the framework's internal browser telemetry (`trackEvent()` / automatic pageviews — see [Browser defaults](#browser-defaults) below), which powers Agent Native's own product analytics. Use `track()` for your app's own analytics events that should reach your configured providers.

## Advanced: custom providers & internals {#advanced}

Most apps only need `track()` / `identify()` and a built-in provider. The rest of the surface — registering custom providers, the `TrackingProvider` interface, batching internals, and the framework's own browser telemetry — is below.

<details>
<summary><strong>Provider-registry API, interface, internals, and browser defaults</strong></summary>

### `registerTrackingProvider(provider)` {#register}

Register a custom provider for any analytics backend.

```ts
import { registerTrackingProvider } from "@agent-native/core/tracking";

registerTrackingProvider({
  name: "my-analytics",
  track(event) {
    // Send event to your backend
    fetch("https://analytics.example.com/events", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify(event),
    }).catch(() => {});
  },
  identify(userId, traits) {
    // Optional — link user identity to future events
  },
  flush() {
    // Optional — called on graceful shutdown
  },
});
```

### `flushTracking()` {#flush}

Flush all providers. Call before process exit to ensure pending events are sent.

```ts
import { flushTracking } from "@agent-native/core/tracking";

await flushTracking();
```

### `unregisterTrackingProvider(name)` {#unregister}

Remove a provider by name. Returns `true` if the provider was found and removed.

### `listTrackingProviders()` {#list}

Returns the names of all registered providers.

### The TrackingProvider interface {#provider-interface}

```ts
interface TrackingProvider {
  name: string;
  track(event: TrackingEvent): void | Promise<void>;
  identify?(
    userId: string,
    traits?: Record<string, unknown>,
  ): void | Promise<void>;
  flush?(): void | Promise<void>;
}

interface TrackingEvent {
  name: string;
  properties?: Record<string, unknown>;
  timestamp?: string;
  userId?: string;
}
```

Only `name` and `track` are required. `identify` and `flush` are optional — implement them if your backend supports user identity and batched delivery.

### How it works {#internals}

- **Batched HTTP** — built-in providers enqueue events and flush every 10 seconds or when 50 events accumulate, whichever comes first. This minimizes outbound requests without losing data.
- **No SDK dependencies** — all built-in providers use raw `fetch()`. No PostHog SDK, no Mixpanel SDK, no Amplitude SDK. Keeps the framework lightweight.
- **Best-effort delivery** — provider errors are caught and logged. A failing analytics integration never crashes the caller or blocks request handling.
- **Global singleton** — the registry uses a `Symbol.for` key on `globalThis` so multiple ESM graph instances (dev-mode Vite + Nitro, symlinks) share one provider set.

### Browser defaults {#browser-defaults}

This covers the framework's own internal telemetry — mostly relevant to framework contributors and advanced template authors.

Template roots call `configureTracking()` once at startup. Browser events sent with `trackEvent()` automatically include app/template context plus the current LLM connection when the app can resolve it:

- `llm_connection` — normalized provider label such as `builder`, `anthropic`, `openai`, `google`, or `none`
- `llm_engine` — the engine id, for example `builder` or `ai-sdk:openai`
- `llm_model` — the selected/default model when known
- `llm_connection_source` — `app_secrets`, `settings`, or `env`
- `llm_connection_configured` — whether an LLM connection is available

The framework also tracks `builder connect clicked` from Connect Builder CTAs, and the server-side Builder connect routes track started/succeeded/failed lifecycle events. `configureTracking()` is called automatically by the framework; you don't need to call it in your own template code.
