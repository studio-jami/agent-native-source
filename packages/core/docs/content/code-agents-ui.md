# Agent-Native Code UI

Agent-Native Code is the Agent-Native coding surface: a local Claude Code/Codex-style workspace for coding sessions, slash commands, migrations, audits, transcripts, and follow-ups.

There are three layers:

- **CLI**: `npx @agent-native/core@latest code` starts and resumes runs.
- **Desktop**: the left-sidebar Code surface adds native terminal launch, app webviews, and desktop deep links.
- **Shared UI**: `@agent-native/code-agents-ui` renders the reusable React surface.

The shared UI is host-driven. It does not know whether it is running in Electron, a browser template, or a future hosted shell. Hosts provide a `CodeAgentsHost` implementation.

```ts
import { CodeAgentsApp, type CodeAgentsHost } from "@agent-native/code-agents-ui";
import "@agent-native/code-agents-ui/styles.css";

const host: CodeAgentsHost = {
  listRuns: (goalId) => listRunsSomehow(goalId),
  listCodePacks: () => listCodePacksSomehow(),
  createRun: (request) => createRunSomehow(request),
  readTranscript: (request) => readTranscriptSomehow(request),
  appendFollowUp: (request) => appendFollowUpSomehow(request),
  updateRun: (request) => updateRunSomehow(request),
  retryRun: (request) => retryRunSomehow(request),
  rerunRun: (request) => rerunRunSomehow(request),
  controlRun: (goalId, runId, command, permissionMode) =>
    controlRunSomehow({ goalId, runId, command, permissionMode }),
};

export function CodeSurface() {
  return <CodeAgentsApp apps={[]} host={host} />;
}
```

## Desktop Host

Desktop uses the shared UI but keeps privileged capabilities in Electron:

- opening a native terminal
- rendering optional app-backed surfaces with `AppWebview`
- handling `agentnative://open?...` links
- tracking local run processes
- recording steering vs queued follow-ups for active runs
- retrying and re-running native Code sessions, including `/migrate` and `/audit`
- stopping a process it started

That separation matters. The UI can be reused by templates, but native process control should stay in Desktop or CLI.

## Browser Template

The hidden `code` template is a starting point for building your own Agent-Native Code UI:

```bash
npx @agent-native/core@latest create my-code-ui --template code
cd my-code-ui
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Inside the framework repo, run it directly with:

```bash
cd templates/code
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The template wraps the local run store through normal actions:

- `list-code-agent-runs`
- `list-code-agent-packs`
- `create-code-agent-run`
- `read-code-agent-transcript`
- `append-code-agent-follow-up`
- `update-code-agent-run`
- `control-code-agent-run`

It uses `@agent-native/core/code-agents`, which exposes the same file-backed run store and executor used by the CLI.

## Run Store

Local Agent-Native Code runs are stored at:

```text
~/.agent-native/code-agents
```

Set `AGENT_NATIVE_CODE_AGENTS_HOME` to isolate a template or test run store.

```bash
AGENT_NATIVE_CODE_AGENTS_HOME=./data/code-agents pnpm dev
```

## Host Contract

`CodeAgentsHost` is intentionally small:

| Method                                                | Purpose                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `listRuns(goalId?)`                                   | List sessions for the selected goal                    |
| `listCodePacks?()`                                    | List `.agents/commands` and `.agents/skills`           |
| `createRun(request)`                                  | Start a new run                                        |
| `readTranscript(request)`                             | Read transcript/tool/status events                     |
| `appendFollowUp(request)`                             | Add a follow-up, either steering active work or queued |
| `updateRun(request)`                                  | Update mode or run metadata                            |
| `retryRun?(request)`                                  | Retry the selected run in place                        |
| `rerunRun?(request)`                                  | Start a new run from a previous prompt                 |
| `controlRun(goalId, runId, command, permissionMode?)` | Resume, approve, refresh, or stop                      |
| `openTerminal?(request)`                              | Optional native terminal hook                          |

Browser hosts should return a graceful `openTerminal` error instead of trying to emulate native terminal launch.

## Shared Composer

Agent-Native Code uses the same `AgentComposerFrame` + `PromptComposer` /
`TiptapComposer` stack as the framework agent sidebar. Do not fork a separate
textarea, shell, upload picker, voice button, model picker, or Enter-to-submit
implementation for Code-like surfaces. If a host needs one extra control, pass
it through the shared composer extension points so the sidebar, Code UI, and
Brain chat keep the same interaction model and visual field.

Brain's Ask route uses `AgentChatSurface`, which is already backed by the
standard sidebar composer. Code uses `PromptComposer` directly because the host
owns run creation, transcripts, and follow-up delivery.

Code-specific UI belongs around the composer, not inside a forked chatfield. The
shared Code UI may add slots for:

- Auto / Plan mode controls.
- The selected cwd, project picker, and run metadata.
- Host-only affordances such as opening a terminal.

Everything else stays in the shared composer: attachments, references, slash and
skill insertion, pasted-text handling, voice dictation, drafts, keyboard
shortcuts, and submission semantics.

## Slash Commands

Agent-Native Code treats migration as a capability, not a separate app category. `/migrate` can be a built-in goal, a project command, or a custom instruction pack on top of the same host contract.

Project-specific commands live in:

```text
.agents/commands/*.md
```

Use these for team workflows such as release checks, migration variants, framework upgrades, or audits.

Project skills live in:

```text
.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md
```

When the host implements `listCodePacks`, the shared UI shows project commands and skills in the rail. Command rows insert `/<command>`, and skill rows insert a focused “Use the <skill> skill…” prompt so the rail stays actionable. Built-in names such as `/migrate`, `/audit`, `/status`, and `/resume` stay reserved for the global Agent-Native Code controls.

Do not create a separate slash-command registry for a new Code host. Project
commands and skills are discovered from `.agents/commands/*.md` and
`.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`; the UI should render those packs and insert prompts
through the shared composer.

## Background Agent Harness

Background coding-agent work should reuse the same harness as the rest of
Agent-Native:

- Use the Code run store/executor for local Code sessions.
- Use core `run-manager` for hosted agent runs so streams, aborts, heartbeats,
  resumability, soft timeouts, and stuck-run cleanup behave consistently.
- Use `agent-teams` / `spawnTask()` when the UI is delegating work to a
  background sub-agent from a normal app chat.

Do not add a parallel background-agent runner just because a new surface needs a
different layout. Build a host adapter or UI slot on top of the shared harness
instead.

## Follow-Ups

Follow-ups on active runs support two delivery modes:

- **Send now** records a steering prompt that the active runner applies at the next safe continuation point.
- **Queue** runs after the current turn finishes.

Inactive runs keep the compatible behavior: the follow-up is appended and the run resumes immediately.

## Remote Dispatch

Desktop can expose the local Code Agent runner to a deployed Dispatch relay so a
phone or Telegram chat can start, monitor, and continue sessions while the
computer is awake.

The connection is outbound-only from Desktop:

1. Desktop pairs with Dispatch and stores a device token locally.
2. Desktop long-polls `/_agent-native/integrations/remote/poll`.
3. Mobile Sessions and Telegram `/code` enqueue commands in the relay database.
4. Desktop claims commands, drives the local run store, and posts results and
   transcript events back to Dispatch.
5. Mobile reads `hosts`, `runs`, and `transcript` from Dispatch; it never talks
   directly to the desktop.

The canonical remote relay endpoints are:

| Method     | Route                                                    | Caller          | Purpose                                     |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `POST`     | `/_agent-native/integrations/remote/register`            | Desktop session | Pair a desktop host and return a token once |
| `GET`      | `/_agent-native/integrations/remote/hosts`               | Mobile/session  | List paired hosts                           |
| `DELETE`   | `/_agent-native/integrations/remote/devices/:id`         | Mobile/session  | Revoke a paired host                        |
| `POST`     | `/_agent-native/integrations/remote/devices/:id/revoke`  | Mobile/session  | Revoke a paired host                        |
| `POST/GET` | `/_agent-native/integrations/remote/poll`                | Desktop token   | Claim work                                  |
| `POST`     | `/_agent-native/integrations/remote/result`              | Desktop token   | Complete or fail work                       |
| `POST`     | `/_agent-native/integrations/remote/run-events`          | Desktop token   | Mirror transcript events                    |
| `GET`      | `/_agent-native/integrations/remote/runs`                | Mobile/session  | List sessions                               |
| `GET`      | `/_agent-native/integrations/remote/runs/:id`            | Mobile/session  | Read session summary                        |
| `GET`      | `/_agent-native/integrations/remote/runs/:id/transcript` | Mobile/session  | Read mirrored transcript                    |
| `POST`     | `/_agent-native/integrations/remote/push/register`       | Mobile/session  | Register Expo/mobile push token             |

Telegram uses the same relay through Dispatch. Supported commands are:

```text
/code <prompt>
/code list
/code status <run>
/code continue <run> <text>
/code approve <id>
/code deny <id>
/code stop <run>
```

### Smoke checklist

Before shipping a remote-control change, run the automated relay route smoke in
`remote-plugin.spec.ts`, then do one real-device pass:

1. Pair Desktop from Settings and confirm the host appears in mobile Sessions.
2. Start a session from mobile and confirm Desktop claims it.
3. Send `/code <prompt>` from Telegram and confirm it queues to the same host.
4. Verify transcript mirroring, follow-up, approve or deny, and stop.
5. Revoke the host from mobile and confirm new commands stay queued/offline
   instead of being sent to the revoked device.
6. Enable mobile push alerts and confirm command completion creates a push
   outbox row.

## Styling

Import the package stylesheet:

```ts
import "@agent-native/code-agents-ui/styles.css";
```

The stylesheet uses the same shadcn-style HSL custom properties as the templates and Desktop shell. Prefer changing tokens or small class overrides in the host app before forking the shared UI.

## Limits

The browser template is local-first. It can start and resume runs while its local Node server is alive. For native process lifecycle, terminal launch, and app webviews, use Desktop.
