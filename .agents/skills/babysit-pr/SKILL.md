description: Monitor a PR, fix feedback and CI failures until fully green for 30 min. Run with /babysit-pr <number>
user_invocable: true
---

Monitor PR #$ARGUMENTS in the current repo. Fix CI failures and human or bot review feedback until everything is green and no new feedback arrives for 30 minutes.

**If no PR number is given**, auto-detect it: get the current branch (`git branch --show-current`), find the open PR for it (`gh pr list --head <branch> --state open --json number --limit 1`). If no open PR exists, check recent merged/closed PRs. Only ask the user if no PR can be found.

## Setup

1. Start a `/loop 3m` that checks for new feedback and CI status every 3 minutes. The local-change commit/push step runs once per tick so active work batches naturally instead of creating push spam.
2. Track when the last actionable item (new human/bot feedback or CI fix) occurred
3. After 30 minutes of no new actionable items with GitHub Actions CI green, cancel the loop and report "All clear"

## Each tick

**Step 0 — always do this first, before anything else:**

1. Run `git status --short` to check for local uncommitted changes from concurrent agents.
2. If any exist: look at `git diff --stat` to understand what changed, then write a descriptive commit message based on the actual changes (e.g. "feat(tools): add error toast + dark mode sync" or "fix(analytics): update sidebar layout"). Never use generic messages like "chore: sweep concurrent agent changes".
3. `git add <files> && git commit -m "<descriptive message>" && git push`.
4. Run `git log --oneline origin/<branch>..HEAD` to check for local commits not yet on the remote.
5. If any unpushed commits exist: `git push`.

This ensures every tick starts with a clean, fully-pushed working tree. Never skip this step.

**Never `git stash` concurrent changes.** Stashes get orphaned, and a stash named `babysit-tickN-concurrent-work-*` left on the source branch while babysit-pr's PR ships without it is exactly how real work has been lost (2026-05-05: stash@{0} held a Sentry-instrumentation feature for clips, including a new `analytics.ts` module, that was meant to merge with PR #511's followup but stayed stuck in the stash list because babysit stashed instead of committing). If you see local changes you don't recognize, that's still other agents' work — commit it with a descriptive message based on the diff, don't hide it in a stash.

**Step 1 — check for merge conflicts:**

1. Run `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json mergeable --jq '.mergeable'`.
2. If `CONFLICTING`: rebase on main (`git fetch origin main && git rebase origin/main`), resolve conflicts, commit, and push. This resets the soak timer.
3. If `MERGEABLE` or `UNKNOWN`: proceed.

**Then proceed with PR checks:**

1. Check for new review comments and review summaries from humans and bots:
   ```bash
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$ARGUMENTS/comments --jq '.[] | select(.created_at > "<30min_ago>") | {id, user: .user.login, type: .user.type, path: .path, body: .body[0:300]}'
   gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$ARGUMENTS/reviews --jq '.[] | select(.submitted_at > "<30min_ago>") | select(.body != null and .body != "") | {id, user: .user.login, type: .user.type, state, body: .body[0:1000]}'
   ```

2. Check CI status:
   ```bash
   gh pr checks $ARGUMENTS
   ```

3. **If new human or bot feedback includes real bugs or requested changes**:
   - Read the relevant files
   - Fix the issues
   - Run `pnpm run prep` to verify locally
   - Commit and push
   - Reply inline to each addressed inline comment, or post a PR comment summarizing addressed items when the feedback was in a review body
   - Reset the 30-min timer

4. **If GitHub Actions CI is failing** (lint, test, typecheck, build):
   - Investigate the failure logs
   - Fix the root cause
   - Run `pnpm run prep` locally
   - Commit and push
   - Reset the 30-min timer

   **Special case: missing changeset.** If the failing job is `Require changeset for publishable package changes` (from `.github/workflows/changeset-check.yml`), do NOT treat it as a code bug. The job log includes a structured line `MISSING_CHANGESET_PACKAGES: pkg1,pkg2`. Parse that, then write a `.changeset/<short-slug>.md` directly — do NOT run the interactive `pnpm changeset add`. Use the PR title and diff to decide bump type (default to `patch` for bugfixes / docs / refactors; `minor` for additive features; `major` only when the PR description clearly signals breaking). Shape:
   ```md
   ---
   "@agent-native/<pkg-1>": patch
   "@agent-native/<pkg-2>": patch
   ---

   <one-line summary derived from the PR title>
   ```
   Slug example: `dispatch-route-shells.md` (kebab-case, descriptive, ~3 words). Commit with `chore: add changeset for <packages>`, push, reset the timer. The check will pass on the next CI run.

5. **If only external CI fails** (Cloudflare Workers, Netlify, etc.) and GitHub Actions passes:
   - Note the failure but don't block on it — these may need dashboard config changes
   - Do NOT reset the 30-min timer for external-only failures

6. **If everything green + no new feedback for 30 min**: cancel the loop, report done

## Responding to feedback

**Every human or bot comment must get a reply** — either a fix or an explanation of why you're skipping it.

- If you fix it: commit, push, AND reply inline confirming the fix. Fixing code marks the comment as "outdated" in GitHub's UI, but the user needs to see the reply to know you addressed it — don't rely on the outdated status alone.
- If you skip it: reply to the comment via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/$ARGUMENTS/comments/{id}/replies -f body="..."` explaining why (pre-existing, false positive, not practical, etc.)
- If the issue is real but you didn't introduce it: fix it anyway and reply. Real bugs should be fixed regardless of who wrote the code.
- If feedback appears in a review summary/body rather than an inline thread: fix the items you agree with, then post a top-level PR comment referencing the review and listing what was fixed; explicitly mention any items you skipped or disagreed with and why.
- **Never silently ignore a human or bot comment** — every single one must have a reply so the user can verify everything was addressed.

## Evaluating feedback — be skeptical

Skip (with a reply explaining why) issues that are:
- Pre-existing (not introduced by this PR)
- False positives / don't hold up to scrutiny
- Nitpicks a senior engineer wouldn't flag
- Things linter/typechecker catches (CI handles those)
- Style/formatting issues
- Already addressed in a previous commit

Fix issues that are:
- Real runtime bugs introduced by this PR
- Security issues
- CLAUDE.md violations
- Data loss risks

## Merging

**Never auto-merge by default.** Only merge when the user explicitly asks you to.

When the user does ask to merge, all of these must be true **simultaneously for 10 consecutive minutes** before merging:

1. **No local uncommitted changes** — `git status --short` must be empty
2. **No unpushed commits** — `git log --oneline origin/<branch>..HEAD` must be empty
3. **All GitHub Actions CI green** — Build, Lint, Test, Typecheck, Scaffold E2E, Guard
4. **All review comments addressed** — every human/bot inline comment and review-body item has a fix or a reply
5. **No merge conflicts** — `gh pr view --json mergeable --jq '.mergeable'` must be `MERGEABLE`

The 10-minute soak timer **resets to zero** whenever you push anything, CI fails, a new review comment arrives, merge conflicts appear, or local changes are found and committed.

Only after 10 consecutive clean minutes, force merge with `gh pr merge <number> --squash --admin`.

## Stop conditions

- No new actionable feedback AND GitHub Actions green for 30 consecutive minutes
- PR is merged or closed
