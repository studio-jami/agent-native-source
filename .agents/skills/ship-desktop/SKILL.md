# Ship Desktop

End-to-end local install of the Agent Native Electron app. Produces an **unsigned, un-notarized arm64 DMG** — fine for local use on Steve's M-series Mac. This skill intentionally bypasses codesign/notarize because they only work in CI (`.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml`) where the Apple secrets live.

## When to use

- "Rebuild and install the desktop app"
- "Ship the desktop app locally"
- After touching anything under `packages/desktop-app/`
- After bumping a dependency that affects the shell (main/preload/renderer)

## Pre-flight

```bash
ls packages/desktop-app/package.json      # sanity: we're at framework root
pgrep -f "/Applications/Agent Native.app" # note if it's currently running
```

## Steps

### 1. Build arm64 DMG (unsigned)

Universal builds silently stall during the merge step locally (npm dep collector noise). Build arm64-only — it's what Steve's machine runs anyway.

```bash
cd packages/desktop-app
pnpm exec electron-vite build
CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false pnpm exec electron-builder --mac dmg --arm64 \
  -c.mac.notarize=false \
  -c.mac.identity=null \
  -c.mac.target.target=dmg \
  -c.mac.target.arch=arm64 \
  > /tmp/desktop-build.log 2>&1
```

The build runs for ~1–2 minutes. Watch for `building target=DMG arch=arm64 file=dist/Agent Native.dmg` near the end. Skip the `npm error missing/invalid` noise — it's from the `npm ls` dep collector inside a pnpm workspace and is harmless.

If it finishes without writing `dist/Agent Native.dmg`, grep the log for `Error|Failed|exited.*code=[^0]` — a real failure will show up there.

### 2. Quit the running copy

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "Agent Native" to quit' || true
sleep 2
pgrep -f "/Applications/Agent Native.app/Contents/MacOS/Agent Native" | xargs -r kill
```

### 3. Patch the built .app for macOS Tahoe Liquid Glass

electron-builder ships only `icon.icns`. macOS 26 (Tahoe) draws the dynamic Liquid Glass bezel/specular only when an app has both `Assets.car` (compiled from our `.icon` bundle) AND `CFBundleIconName` set in `Info.plist`. `scripts/build-branding-assets.mjs` produces `packages/desktop-app/build/Assets.car` from `packages/core/src/assets/branding/agent-native.icon`. Install it directly into the unpacked `.app` before copying it to `/Applications` (skip the DMG — it's just compressed packaging).

```bash
APP="packages/desktop-app/dist/mac-arm64/Agent Native.app"
cp packages/desktop-app/build/Assets.car "$APP/Contents/Resources/Assets.car"
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Add :CFBundleIconName string agent-native" "$APP/Contents/Info.plist" 2>/dev/null \
  || /usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Set :CFBundleIconName agent-native" "$APP/Contents/Info.plist"
```

### 4. Install to /Applications

```bash
rm -rf "/Applications/Agent Native.app"
cp -R "packages/desktop-app/dist/mac-arm64/Agent Native.app" /Applications/
```

### 5. Refresh icon caches + launch

macOS aggressively caches Dock/Finder icons. Without flushing, a fresh `.icns` won't show until logout. The `mv … .tmp && mv … back` is the no-`killall Dock` cache buster (the agent sandbox usually denies `killall Dock`).

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Agent Native.app" 2>/dev/null
/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -f "/Applications/Agent Native.app"
find ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.iconservices.store -type f -delete 2>/dev/null
rm -f /private/var/folders/*/C/com.apple.dock.iconcache 2>/dev/null
mv "/Applications/Agent Native.app" "/Applications/Agent Native.app.tmp" && mv "/Applications/Agent Native.app.tmp" "/Applications/Agent Native.app"
open "/Applications/Agent Native.app"
```

## Notes

- **Why not `pnpm run build:mac`?** That script runs universal + notarize + sign, which hangs on missing `APPLE_ID` / `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` env vars (only set in GitHub Actions). The universal merge step also silently aborts locally.
- **Shipping for real** — use the `Desktop App Release` GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml`). Never publish a locally-built artifact.
- **Data preserved** — user settings live in `~/Library/Application Support/Agent Native/`. Reinstalling does not touch them.
- **If the app won't open** after install, check Console.app for `Agent Native` entries — common cause is a stale Electron helper still running from the old version.
